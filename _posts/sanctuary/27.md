<Narration>The next day at noon. Nearby SANCTUARY's entrance.</Narration>

<Thought>{`(...Nothing ended up happening yesterday.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Nii~chan and Tomoya-kun didn't come back, and we just played around at SANCTUARY all day long.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But SANCTUARY is a lot of fun. I think it's a really wonderful amusement park.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(It's new and exciting, and it's filled to the brim with Tori-kun and everyone else's sparkling, glittering <span className="hold">ideas—)</span>`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But even still, nothing here is real.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(The other idols that show up on my collier, like that fake version of Akehoshi-senpai, give me plenty of praise...)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(It automatically detects when my mood is dropping and sends me comfort. It manages to be pretty encouraging.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(It says things that are convenient for me, the things that I want to hear the most.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(And that certainly does make me happy, and it lifts my spirits in that moment.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But in the end, it's not real. It just makes everything feel more and more empty.)`}</Thought>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Gyah?! D-Don't just grab onto me so suddenly, Mitsuru-kun! Or at least go easy on me; my bones are going to break!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

My bad! But when someone's all down in the dumps, someone else should share their excitement with 'em! So I'll cheer you up and make you happy, and then we can walk together hand in hand!

We'll keep on going! That's what Ra<span className="noCase">\*</span>bits is all about!

Hajime-chan and everyone else've always done the same thing for me, yanno? So this time I'm taking charge! Huuuuggles&NoBreak;♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ahaha... How do you always manage to know exactly what I want you to do, Mitsuru-kun?

From one idol to another, I truly respect you a lot.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Ehem☆ C'mon, gimme more! Really lay it on thick!

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Good job! I'm always so proud of you guys.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Nii~chan?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Nii~chaaaaaan☆

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

H-hey now! C'mon, Mitsuru! I'm not gonna let you land one on me!

I know what you're trying to do, but I've been working out so I can catch you if get all over-excited and jump at m&NoBreak;—

Ow ow oww!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Nii~chan, Nii~chan, Nii~chan, Nii~chan☆

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Wait—hang on a second, Mitsuru-kun! His bones are going to snap! You're crushing him!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

I-I'm fine... I've gotten used to all this, and if I've braced myself for it I can handle it. For the most part.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

O-Oh, okay. But Nii~chan, aren't you supposed to be a princess locked in a castle right now? Why are you here?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Um? A princess, huh...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

...We were so worried about you, Nii~chan. You left without saying anything.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Yeah... I'm sorry about that. But if you've got any complaints, take them up with Tenshouin.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Huh? Eichi-onii-chan? Oh right, he suddenly disappeared yesterday and never came back...

</Bubble>

<Image src="/img/tl/sanctuary/27/3.jpg" alt="Chapter image 3" layout="responsive" width="1560" height="720" quality="100" />

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

I keep telling you, _I'm_ your only Nii~chan, okay?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Wawah? I'm sorry! Please don't give me a noogie! I just try really hard to listen to other people's requests of me&NoBreak;—

A long time ago, I was a lot more shy than I am now. I couldn't speak up for myself at all, so I kept everything I felt bottled up inside of me.

That was really painful for me. I don't want anyone else to go through that.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

I get it. Well, just make sure you're not overdoing it.

Also, I'm pretty sure the reason Tenshouin isn't here is just because he's busy.

Well, he made his bed. He's standing at death's doorstep, and he crams his schedule as full as it'll get because he doesn't know when that door will open for him.

It makes it hard for people like Momo-chin who just wanna stick by his side and cuddle up close to him.

Oh, speaking of Momo-chin... What are those guys up to?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

&lt;Please stand back! Line up properly, and proceed forward starting from those who have completed the designated procedures!&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

&lt;Hey! Do what you're told, you ignorant fools!&gt;

&lt;The fastest way to do this is to just behave yourselves and wait your turn! Why're you trying so hard to cut in line?!&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

...No seriously, what're they up to? Traffic control?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Umm, most of the idols placed in Kanto have been playing around at SANCTUARY since yesterday&NoBreak;—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Yup! There's a hotel inside the park, and we even got to sleep on some insanely cushy beds! And the food's so yummy!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Yes, we were shown the best hospitality possible.

But today, all the other idols suddenly started saying they want to leave SANCTUARY.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Why so sudden?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Umm, I don't really know the reason.

Honestly, I would have done the same. But I heard you and Tomoya-kun were still here at SANCTUARY, and I thought we might be able to meet up with you.

I feel like they're thinking they have to get out as soon as they possibly can.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Hmm, I see. So all the idols are trying to leave at the same time&NoBreak;—

Basically, the place is so jam-packed 'cause of everyone crowding around the entrance.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Yeah. And Tori-kun and the other management working at SANCTUARY saw this and are essentially trying to do traffic control.

Maybe it's because the park isn't officially open to the public yet, so it looks like they don't have enough staff right now.

We offered to help, but Tori-kun just told us not to do anything we didn't have to, since we're guests.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Yup! Kinda rude if you ask me, we're supposed to help each other when we're in trouble!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Hmm... I get it now. So Tenshouin's whole "experiment" thing is working. Well _that's_ obnoxious.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

......?
