<Bubble character="Eichi">

Hehe. Now, now... Whatever shall I do...?

I should've expected this when I heard of the news, but seeing it firsthand truly pains me.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Tenshouin-senpai!

Ahh, I'm _so_ glad you're hereeee! Someone that I finally know! So, just _what_ the hell is this place?! Do you know anything about it?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Oh my, what a surprising reaction.

Hmm... Since Wataru's skilled in mimicry, I thought that he would immediately recognize me with the slightest change...<Fn num="1">Remember the police officer in ["Circuit of Happiness (15)"](/tl/sanctuary/18)? Well, here he is: Eichi Tenshouin.</Fn>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

......?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

But Wataru is acting quite unusual right now. I've recorded both of your actions up to this point, and I'd say that his behavior has been nothing like his usual self.

I guess what Gatekeeper said was true after all, but...

Why would Wataru ever suggest such a thing?

I have several theories on this, yet I truly never imagined that Wataru would do such an absurd&NoBreak;—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Uhm...? Huh? Tenshouin-senpai? Can you hear me? Helloooo?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Oh. Sorry, Mashiro-kun. I didn't mean to ignore you. I just got a little too lost in my thoughts.

I can't afford to be so careless, since I promised Hajime-kun that I'd unite with you two.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Hajime...? Did something happen to him? Don't tell me that the others are also lost in this weird town!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Not at all. They're all safe and sound in a sanctuary I've built where no evil can enter.

I can take you there too, if you wish. Where Hajime-kun and your other friends are, that is.

That was the initial plan. Rather, I must ask you this: Why are you in the Dark Side? It's still under construction.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Dark...Side?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Hmm, I see you don't know anything... I thought Wataru would at least explain it to you.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Oh, about that! Apparently, Hibiki-senpai has amnesia, and that's why he couldn't even recognize me!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

So it seems. Looks like what Gatekeeper told me lines up with everything.

Hmm. That means all of his answers were straightforward and true...

Was he doing this in good faith so that we could continue working together in the future? Or does he really not care about idols?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

...? Is this "Gatekeeper" person that scary dude? The president of the SS Administration Committee?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

So that's the impression you got, huh. I assume you haven't interacted with him much, then.

Alright. I think I've got the gist of it now&NoBreak;♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

B-But _I_ still don't understand! Don't just keep everything to yourself—explain it to me too!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Hmm... Whatever shall I do? I despise you a little for stealing Wataru away from me. Maybe I should belittle you a bit.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

_Excuse me?_ I didn't "steal" Hibiki-senpai! He just happened to lose his memories, so I ended up protecting him!

</Bubble>

<Image src="/img/tl/sanctuary/24/2.jpg" alt="Chapter image 2" layout="responsive" width="1560" height="720" quality="100" />

<Bubble character="Eichi">

You "just happened" to find and protect Wataru? In this large, unknown town? Really...?

No. You were chosen by fate.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

What are you talking about...? God, can't you just talk in a way where even an idiot like me can understand?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

You're not an "idiot," you're "pure." Just like Nito-kun. This is exactly why you are all essential to SANCTUARY.

Or rather, this magnificent experiment that is taking place in SANCTUARY.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Like I said&NoBreak;—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Let's see... According to Gatekeeper, one has to chant this spell in order for Wataru's memories to return.

Wataru was probably the one who came up with it. Have we talked about something like this before?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

So this, um, "spell" will bring Hibiki-senpai's memories...back?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Yes. I wish this were a tale where love and affection would bring his memories back, but...

That would be rather dull, don't you think? Unlike Wataru, I don't like plays without an audience.

"Ah, still delay—thou art so fair!"<Fn num="2">This is a quote from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's [Faust](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm), translated into English by Bayard Taylor.

Whoa?! Uh, Hibiki-senpai? You alright? You're shaking a whole bunch!
