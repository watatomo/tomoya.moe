<Location>SANCTUARY Amusement Park</Location>

<Narration>Around one hour later. Inside SANCTUARY.</Narration>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Got it?

You see, SANCTUARY is an amusement park where anyone can become an idol!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

To be more precise, it's an amusement park in which anyone can experience the joy of being an idol.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

The joy...of being an idol...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

If you need something more concrete, let me show you an example! Come over here&NoBreak;♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Sure! Dash da—

Not dashin', I won't dash! I didn't dash at all!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Oh, right! Because that's your Order, isn't it?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Auugh! Not runnin' is making my stress pent up! Swooosh! Swowowosh!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ahh, please stop moving your arms so much, Mitsuru-kun! You could hit someone!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Indeed. Currently, it's undergoing a beta test, and as such, regular customers aren't allowed inside the park at the moment.

Still, there is a crowd gathered, so we would appreciate it if you avoided causing a commotion.

Tenma-sama, you too would be unhappy if you injured someone, wouldn't you?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Alrighty! Goootcha, Yuzu-chan-senpai!&NoBreak;<Fn num="1">Originally, Mitsuru called Yuzuru "Butler Bro" (執事のに～ちゃん, <em>butler no nii~chan</em>). Yuzuru replied to him by repeating the nickname, as if he was amused by it.</Fn> I'll behave!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Hehe. You're correct, there are some people walking around. But somehow I feel I have seen all of them before. Could it be...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Yep. All these people walking around SANCTUARY right now are idols from Kanto.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Indeed. They've given up on their chance of ruling over us, and so they're now drifters.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ahh, so that's how it is. There weren't any active idols other than us, so I was wondering what happened to them.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Right. They might be trying to cut their monetary losses—or rather, they could be trying to avoid more matches they might lose. That's not a bad call.

To appear on stage as idols, they need money.

And all the money earned in the qualifiers is SSL$, so it will disappear once it's over.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Oh, there's a rule like that?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Yes. If you perform well in the qualifying rounds, ES will view you favorably; this opens more opportunities to earn money.

Thanks to the presence of one of the Big Three units, fine, in this region, everyone retired early because there wouldn't be many chances to stand out.

They decided it'd be wiser to step back and wait for a better moment than to take on a very unfavorable bet.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

So basically, all we'll see is wimps around here.

If it were Trickstar, it wouldn't matter that all odds were against them—they'd still run in without hesitation.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Yes. At the very least, I think that the idols I respect so much wouldn't give up so easily.

Not only that, they'd do it to bring happiness to everyone, not for money. It's not about winning or losing but&NoBreak;— Aahhh?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Calm down, Hajime-chan! Gather your thoughts! Breathe in, breathe out!

</Bubble>

<Image src="/img/tl/sanctuary/14/2.jpg" alt="Chapter image 2" layout="responsive" width="1560" height="720" quality="100" />

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Breathe in... Breathe out...! Ugh, sorry for being so bad at speaking!

Usually, Nii~chan or Tomoya-kun would talk and say everything that I'd want to, so I could just smile and nod.

But right now it's just me and Mitsuru-kun. Mitsuru-kun's always honest, but it's a little difficult to understand him sometimes, so I should step up too.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Do your best, Hajime-chan! I'm always here cheerin' for ya!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Yes! I will do my best!

Huh? Uhm... What was I talking about again...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

You two are just adorable, y'know?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ehh? Thank you very much! You're cute too, Tori-kun&NoBreak;♪
