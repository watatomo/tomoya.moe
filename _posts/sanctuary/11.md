Well then, now that the anxiety you felt from not knowing where your friends are should have faded away—

I will once again give an explanation about SANCTUARY.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

If you excuse me... Since we are talking about companions we don't know the whereabouts of, I've been thinking that I haven't seen Hibiki-sama in quite a while.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ah, now that you mention it, Hibiki-senpai isn't here. It seemed like all of fine was getting along rather well these days, though?

How careless of me... I'm always so anxious about myself that I end up not paying attention to everyone else around me.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

It's alrighty! There's things you won't be able to focus on by yourself, but that's why the four of us are here!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

That's right. ...About Wataru, pay no mind to him. He's quite the free spirit.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Well, he is someone who wouldn't die so easily. I wasn't necessarily expressing any concerns about him.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Yup. I bet he's just preparing a bunch of new tricks\~! That guy sometimes disappears after saying he's gonna do that.

Once in a while I wonder if he uses that as an excuse to go grab a meal or something.

But regardless of what happens to him, he'll be okay and back with that annoying laugh like nothing happened before you know it.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Yes. That's very like him. I think so too.

Either way, what do you think about the qualifiers we're going through here in Kanto?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Eh? Well, even if you ask me what I think... I have the feeling there isn't that much excitement.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

I don't really think! Whatever happens around me, I'll always be myself and give it my very best shot!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

That's what you think, but it's probably better if you don't get the idea that all the other idols are good hardworking kids like you.

Humans are destined to become lazy. As long as we are animals, this is something akin to an instinct.

In the wild, this would be for the sake of preserving energy and not dying.

Because if someone gives their best every single time they do any work, they're bound to burn out and perish.

Modern society is full of those who believe that even if they don't work hard they can still live—that living a lazy life is correct.

Or rather, those who struggle and squirm desperately despite not being in mortal danger are the ones who are strange.

This function that we should have as living beings might have gotten broken at some point along the way.

But you know, I believe we gained something that made us human precisely because it's broken. We are now sitting at the very top of this planet, precisely because we deviated from the ways of all other living beings.

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

If you start talkin' about complicated stuff, I'll get sleepy!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Refusing to think more than you should is the correct thing to do as a living creature, Tenma-kun. Our brains are gluttonous, so if we stop to think about every single detail we are presented with, we will be left without energy.

That's why phrases like "think," "do something," or "give it your best" all have the same meaning as "go die" when someone says them.

But of course, saying things like that is bound to be met with some backlash.

Still. Back when we were in high school, we were young and inexperienced—it was something we hadn't realized.

We—who were always "giving our utmost best"—were right, so everyone else who wasn't trying hard enough was wrong.

The constantly very serious Keito would always say that with dissatisfaction. That something was weird, there was a mistake somewhere—

Therefore we had to start a revolution.

I wanted to reform the conscience of those who were playing to be an idol, living as if they were already dead. I aimed for the ideal where motivation would just overflow from everyone.

Stirring myself with a vow like that, we truly started a revolution. Because we believed from our very core that was just.

And then the miraculous existence called Trickstar were the ones who accomplished a _real_ revolution.

That's why I was deeply moved when I saw them shining more brightly than anyone else in last year's SS.

Ahh, we weren't wrong at all. I thought so from the bottom of my heart.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Yes. Akehoshi-senpai and the others were amazing last year. Even now, I still feel like tearing up whenever I remember it.

Even though something so cruel happened, he was able to stand on stage and shine so brightly, bringing happiness to everyone.

I have always looked up to him. We want to become like that too—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

You will. That's why we have Ensemble Square and SANCTUARY.

A system created so the miraculous existence of Trickstar doesn't become "a fleeting shooting star shining in the night sky."

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

What could you mean...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

A picture is worth a thousand words. Rather than explaining it myself, it would be easier to show it. Everyone, follow me♪

Let me show you how the dream we once imagined looks like now.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

......?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

<Thought>(—You must be seeing this from somewhere, Wataru.)</Thought>

<Thought>(Look at it. Become aware of it. And if you agree with me this time, I would be happy.)</Thought>

<Thought>(If not... I will have no choice but to walk over your corpse once again.)</Thought>

<Thought>(.........)</Thought>
