Hehe. We're idols in our everyday lives, so we can't truly appreciate this.

But now, even ordinary guests can become idols at SANCTUARY.

They can all become prosperous idols, known across the entire world. As soon as the idol creates their social media account&NoBreak;—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Gwah, the numbers are going up so so so fast! It's freaky!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Ahaha. It's cool, right? This is only the beginning, but look at how fast your follower count is already increasing!

By followers, I mean the people who're interested in you.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Uwah, there's some comments from other people on the screen!

Stuff like "I'm rooting for you!" and "I love you!" and—huh, should I say something back?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Hmm. Yeah, you can reply to them, and the more you do, the more people will keep praising you and saying they like you and stuff.

But it's not like there's actually anyone on the other side of the screen, y'know?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Umm, whaddya mean?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

All those people following your account don't actually, like, exist in real life.

It's just some cutting-edge AI that figures out the best responses and sends them to the person wearing the collier in order to make them happy.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

...? ...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Hey, Hajime. Try jumping up and down in place.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Huh? Uh, okay? Hop hop&NoBreak;♪

L-Like this?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

You're so obedient&NoBreak;♪ Okay, now check your collier.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Umm... Uwah, I'm seeing messages like "OMG, Hajime-kun is hopping around!" and "Sooo cute&NoBreak;♪"

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Yep yep. Whenever you do something at SANCTUARY, you'll get more followers and engagement just like that.

All this AI does is generate what it thinks would be the public's reactions to everything.

So you see? Everyone who comes to SANCTUARY gets to be a famous idol.

Just the fact that you exist is enough to make people go crazy.

Everyone's eyes are on you! They look up to you! They love you! And that's a great feeling no matter who you are, right?

Lots of people became idols because they wanted to stand out and be admired. And at SANCTUARY, anyone can fulfill those desires.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ahaha, I get a little jumpy when I get too much attention.

But I do understand the happiness you feel when someone sees you and showers you with praise.

Being an idol does let you satisfy that desire.

It's not as over-the-top as this is. But I have heard that even when I'm just out shopping, people on social media talk a lot about it.

I only know this because Bishoujo-senpai tells me about it even when I don't ask explicitly, like "There's another rumor going around..."

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Who the heck is Bishoujo-senpai anyway? I've heard about him from time to time, but I've never seen him in person. Does he even exist?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

No, he's real, just like you and me? Although he _does_ kind of seem like a fairy sometimes, or like...something otherworldly?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Hmm. Well, either way, that's how it works. At SANCTUARY, you get to simulate the experience of being a famous idol.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Hm? Okay, so what's the point of that...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Umm, I think Eichi-sama had some super profound wisdom about that, but I don't really get it myself.

Maybe it's to show everyone how great it is to be an idol?

It's really hard to understand just by explaining it, but I'm sure you'll figure it out once you actually experience it.

You know, the gratification of being an idol everyone loves and pays attention to.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ohh, is that it? But being an idol isn't all fun and games, though.

It's really hard when you're not famous, and when no one's looking your way. And sometimes you make mistakes and cause trouble for the people around you, or you get harassed by people with bad intentions...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Yes. However, at SANCTUARY, all of the negative aspects of being an idol have been eliminated.

Here, the concept of the "idol" exists only as a happy, idealized being.

No matter what you do, no matter what results you produce, everyone will love you and admire you.

Of course, the management at SANCTUARY will give a casual warning to guests who take things to extremes.

But punishment of those who break the rules are also carried out behind the scenes. Everything less than perfect is covered up and kept away from this ideal world.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

U-Um, that sounds almost scary...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Hehe. There's no need to worry, Shino-sama. If you don't behave badly, then everything will be just fine. Alright?
