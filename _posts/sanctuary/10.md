<Bubble character="Eichi">

Well then. I'd love to bask in the joy of seeing these cute rabbits squirm some more, but alas...

I wonder if that too is a wicked way to entertain myself. So for now, let's prioritize making you feel at ease.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Feel at ease...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

I'm talking about your friends. Aren't you feeling anxious about what might have happened to the other Ra<span className="noCase">\*</span>bits members who got separated from you?

As long as you're worried about them, any explanation I try to give you is simply going to go in one ear and out the other.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

I-Is that so? Maybe that's the case... Eichi-onii-chan, do you know where Tomoya-kun and Nii~chan might be? Is that why you brought it up?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

I have an estimate of their whereabouts. If you were to think about it logically, in the proper way, you too could deduce it.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

......?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Yuzuru. Teach Hajime-kun and his friend how to use the collier.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Gorilla...? Now's not the time to talk about your favorite animals!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

It is a _collier,_ Tenma-sama. He didn't say gorilla, but colly-ey.

It is the name of this wristwatch-like equipment we're wearing.

</Bubble>

<Image src="/img/tl/sanctuary/10/2.jpg" alt="Chapter image 2" layout="responsive" width="1560" height="720" quality="100" />

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Ahhh, what a waste! You're such a party pooper, Yuzuru!

Tenma-kun went as far as giving such a perfect chance to be the butt of the joke, but you went and gave him the plainest reaction he could receive!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Because I have no interest in doing a comedy skit. Eichi-sama, don't you think you might have been a little too influenced by Trickstar's antics?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Yup. I'm aware of it because I'm a fan of theirs.

But that's precisely why I don't have any intention of letting them end simply as a one-time miracle.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

......?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Hehe. I digress. Right now, where we are in Kanto, there's a grand event happening. These colliers are equipment prepared for its sake.

Losing your collier will cause quite a few inconveniences, so please be careful to not take it off and misplace it.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

I-Is this something that important? I only got told that this is a watch that will earn you money simply by wearing it.

But there's no way we'd get something that nice for free. The world just doesn't work like that.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Tehe. It's not like it's going to explode, so you don't need to be so cautious about it.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Indeed. This collier would be similar to a smartphone.

It's equipment for the sake of making your time at SANCTUARY more enjoyable. There's no risk factor at all.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Huuuh, a phone? I don't really like that kinda stuff! It gets in the way when I'm runnin'!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Running is all you ever care about... Is that the only thing you value?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Hehe. He won't budge on that. I think that people who are simple in such a good way are really <span className="hold">cool♪</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Ehem♪ I don't really get it, but I got praised! Keep it comin'!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Hehe. In any case, these colliers have something similar to a GPS system implanted into them.

SANCTUARY's administrators will know the whereabouts of anyone wearing it.

That, of course, is only true if you don't dismantle it and remove the GPS system.

And so, I'm close enough with the administrators to get in touch with them. Perhaps if I ask, I'd be able to determine the whereabouts of the missing Nito-kun and Mashiro-kun.

Or rather, I already had some suspicions, so I checked it myself. It seems they are quite close to us.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Really?! Where, where? Nii~chaaan! Tomo-chaaan!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Ahaha. Unfortunately, it's not like they're close enough for your shouts to reach them. There's a map with information on the amusement park right here, let's give it a look.

We're currently in this location, the plaza at the entrance of SANCTUARY.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Let's see. There's a building over here listed as the information desk... Somehow this park is way bigger than what I had in mind.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Indeed. In size, I heard it's the biggest in the entire country.

By the way. Nito-kun is here. It seems he's at the castle built in the very middle of SANCTUARY.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Castle... Castle... Woahhh, there really is one! I can see it all the way from here, it's huuuuuuge!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

It sure is. I wonder why Nii~chan is there. Is he a princess...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Eh, what do you mean? Why should he be a princess just because he's in a castle?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ah, it just gives me that kind of image. In fairy tales, people who live in castles tend to be princesses.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Hehe. It's not like he _lives_ there, though.

</Bubble>

<Image src="/img/tl/sanctuary/10/3.jpg" alt="Chapter image 3" layout="responsive" width="1560" height="720" quality="100" />

<Bubble character="Eichi">

On the other hand, Mashiro-kun is here. It seems to be an area still in development.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Of course I mean to say this about Nii~chan too, but what is he doing in a place like that...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Who knows. But that place is off-limits, so I'd like for him to get out of there as soon as possible.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

I-I agree. An area still in development—if that means it's still under construction, there might be a bunch of dangerous things around.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Yes. As such, I have sent someone to pick him up. I think he'll be fine. As long as he doesn't move around too much, they'll be able to meet up with him with ease.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Is that so... I'm glad. What a relief♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Same. But why are Nii~chan and Tomo-chan both already inside the park? They didn't talk to us about it at all, so I was super worried!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Hmm. I'm just guessing here, but it might be related to whatever orders they have been given.

During the qualifying rounds, if someone ever behaves in a strange way, it's very likely that their Order is the reason.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ahh... I-Is that so.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

That Order stuff is _so_ annoying! It's stressin' me out! I wanna dash around!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Tehe. Mitsuru-kun seems to be a bit on edge, I guess this only added to it.

But I see... Because of their Orders, Tomoya-kun and Nii~chan had to leave without saying anything. If that's the case, there's nothing we can do about it.

I heard that if you disobey the Order given to you, you have to pay a fine.

That would mean that all the SSL$ that we have fought our utmost hardest to gain would be gone.

It would mean all the effort we've put in until now would have gone to waste. I kind of don't want to accept that.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

On a similar topic, leaders have a Secret Order, so they are tied down by more restrictions.

As such, if at any time you think my behavior or speech is strange, I'd be happy if you didn't pay much attention to it.

No matter how horrible my actions might become, there is a chance that they weren't done by my own volition.
