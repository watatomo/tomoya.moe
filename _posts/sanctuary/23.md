<Narration>About one hour later.</Narration>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

...It's no use.

Our path gets blocked by a giant wall no matter where we go. It's as if the whole town is inside a dome.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

It sure does... On the outside, it looks like a normal ghost town, but when you examine it more closely, it starts to resemble an indoor movie set. Or like, a miniature model.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I'm not sure what a "movie set" is, but everything around us looks fake. Truly.

The buildings in this area are supposed to be old, but if you take their veneer off, you'll come across material that looks brand new.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Hey, don't just peel the poster off. What if it's against the law?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I don't have any memories so it doooesn't matter!

Look, this poster's all worn out and dull, but when I tear it off, the wall is still as good as new.

You would expect there to be some kind of sticky residue or discoloration around the area where the poster was.

All of the trash is glued to the ground too. You couldn't pick it up even if you tried.

And I don't think that's because it's frozen to the concrete.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

I don't get what you're saying. Just what _is_ this place anyways...?

This place looks like it could be a busy business district, but there are only monsters as far as the eye can see.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Well, good children should be asleep by now.

But for some reason, even without any memories, I know that this place doesn't feel right.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Yeah... At first I thought we got caught up in some space-time distortion and caused us to get isekai'd. Like what happens in manga! But now...

With everything seeming fake? I really don't know... This whole place is sus as hell.

Whoa?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

What happened, Tomoya-kun?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

It's nothing... Um, my watch just started vibrating all of a sudden...

W-We're okay, r-right?! This thing isn't gonna explode, right?! Because this is the same exact shit I've read in those death game manga!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I don't think it will explode. Oh, mine started vibrating as well&NoBreak;♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

And you still look happy despite everything... Though I guess everything's interesting to a baby.

Hmm... Oh, there's some social media app thing on the screen.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Social media?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

It looks like Tw<span className="noCase">\*</span>tter. I don't remember making an account but&NoBreak;— Well, I guess I made one before entering Yumenosaki, though I already deactivated it.

But maybe we can contact someone through this! It's social media, so that means it's connected to the internet, right?

Hm, can I type with these buttons? Let me try to look up—oh, it works! I found Hokuto-senpai's account!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hoku...to?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Right, you forgot about him too! Of _course_ you didn't know him yet at five years old!

But you must _never_ forget Hokuto-senpai, under _any_ circumstances! Every single person on Earth must have his name engraved in gold letters on their heart!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

C-Could you please calm down...? You're scaring me, Tomoya-kun.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ah, sorry. I just get a bit too worked up whenever Hokuto-senpai's involved.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I-I see... So, are you able to get in contact with this Hokuto-senpai?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Wait, I first need to remember how to do that. Err, so what does Tw<span className="noCase">\*</span>tter use&NoBreak;—

Uh, huh? Huuuh...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

What's the matter?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

J-Just look at this. Hokuto-senpai stopped tweeting a year ago.

But his most recent tweet is an announcement about his _retirement._

Huh? _Huh?_ What the hell happened?! Looks like there's a link to a post about it— Shit! The link's dead!

Yikes... He's getting a lot of hate in the replies too.

"Just kill yourself already," "Should've died instead"... Urgh, I don't wanna read this.

It's not just Hokuto-senpai too—it's happening to everyone... Looks like every idol I know of is in the same situation.

Is every idol...retiring? Did they, like, get caught up in a crime and disappear? It says here that some of them got arrested!

Just what the hell is going on here?! Wait, what's this?

I-I found my own account!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

...? What are you panicking for?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

B-Be quiet for a sec. Just what is this...? Wow, these really sound like tweets I'd make...

But apparently I quit being an idol...a long time ago?

Not only did I go back to being an ordinary member of society, I also became some idol anti that sends hate to others?!

T-This is scarily realistic! This me is saying all kinds of crap in the same exact way I actually talk!

I'm not like this at _all!_ This is all fake! Trust me, Hibiki-senpai! I really, _truly_ do respect and admire all the other idols...!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

P-Please calm down! I don't know what's going on at all, but if you don't recall doing any of this, then you should just keep your head up!

I was always considered a strange child, so people often suspected me if there was an incident in the area. However, I always kept my head up instead of making excuses!

I was certain that I did absolutely nothing wrong, because I _knew_ whenever I did!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Y-You might've been able to deal with it in fiction, but it works differently in real life!

If you don't stand up for yourself and got no evidence to back you up, you're gonna get trashed at no matter what! I only know it secondhand, but you were also part of the Five Eccentrics&NoBreak;—

Wait, you wouldn't remember that either, huh.

Tehe. Why not forget everything if all that's left is the sad memories?
