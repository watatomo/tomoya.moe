<Narration>The next day at noon. Somewhere in Kanto at the newly established amusement park, SANCTUARY.</Narration>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Welcome to the amusement park where people of all ages can have fun: SANCTUARY!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

I welcome you, Ra<span className="noCase">\*</span>bits. Although, right now it appears that there are only two of you.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Yes... Both Tomoya-kun and Nii~chan have been missing ever since yesterday.

I'm worried so... I don't think I can have fun in an amusement park right now. You went through the trouble of inviting us, and yet... I'm sorry.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Ahh, don't make such a sad face! A smile suits you better, <span className="hold">Shinonon♪</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Uhm. I already told you so before, but please don't call me Shinonon.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Why not? I'm simply copying the way Subaru-kun calls you. Haven't your fans also started calling you Shinonon these days?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

If it's from my fans it's okay—or rather, I don't mind it.

But in your case, Eichi-onii-chan, how do I say it... It kind of gives me the <span className="hold">creeps—</span>

I'm so sorry!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Hehe. It gives you the creeps... What a cruel thing to say. I'm hurt.

I wonder if you think me calling you Shinonon out of envy for your closeness with Subaru-kun is creepy.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Uhm, eh, what...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

You are right to feel grossed out.

But your disgust fills me with joy like dribbling nectar, so I must insist on calling you so.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ugh... Please stop it, I'm being serious. Or do you not want to be called "Eichi-onii-chan" anymore?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Ah, that would be no good! I can already picture Ritsu-kun proudly boasting about being the only one who gets called "onii-chan"!

My pride wouldn't allow for something like that to happen.

Hehe. You've gotten better at negotiating, Hajime-kun. I promise I won't ever call you Shinonon again.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Yes! Ehehe, I'm happy you finally got <span className="hold">it♪</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Of course I did. I, Eichi-onii-chan, swear that I will never imitate anything that could hurt you.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Onii-chan...♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

.........

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Eichi-sama. For a while now, Tenma-sama has been looking at you as if he were looking at some disgusting bug, so I'd recommend for you to stop playing around.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

I know, right? Hajime, isn't your group involved in some kind of weird situation? Stop messing around or I won't be able to help!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Yes. That's what a noble ought to do.

Hehe. You always remember the most important stuff, <span className="hold">Tori♪</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Eh, ehehe...♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Tehe. How nice. I know I shouldn't be relieved about it, but when Tori-kun is around, I know Eichi-onii-chan will definitely pamper him.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

You're wrong! I have two hands, so I can very easily embrace both of you at the same time...♪

</Bubble>

<Image src="/img/tl/sanctuary/9/3.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1560" height="720" quality="100" />

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Grrrrr! You're weirdin' me out! Stay away from Hajime-chan!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Aah! It's okay! It's okay, Mitsuru-kun! This is normal for him! But for some reason, today he's holding back less than usual...!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Tehe. I can't help it. After all, one of my lifelong dreams has come <span className="hold">true♪</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

This park... I heard Eichi-onii-chan was the one who ordered it to be built.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Building an amusement park was his dream? Hmm... In that case, he's not such a bad guy? Maybe?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

He's being incredibly wary of you, Eichi-sama.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Not wary _enough,_ in my opinion. Young children believe in the innate kindness of others too easily. Quite unfortunate.

After all, not everyone in this world will treat you kindly, and simply being a good child will not guarantee you happiness later in life.

I thought everyone learned that over the summer.
