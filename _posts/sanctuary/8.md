<Narration>Another hour later.</Narration>

<Thought>{`(Urgh... I got so hungry that we ended up using whatever was in the fridge...)<Fn num="1">You can read the cooking scene itself in [Tomoya's rare Mini Talk](/tl/sanctuary/mini_talk/tomoya/2).</Fn>`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Sorry to whoever lives here. I'll pay you back later.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(I feel bad, though. I know I'm doing this because I have to, but it still feels so wrong...)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Well, trespassing someone's home and eating their food is generally considered a crime.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But this is all for survival's sake! We had no other choice!)`}</Thought>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hm? What's the matter, Tomoya-kun?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Oh, it's nothing... I just feel stupid for relying on common sense in weird-ass situations like this.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

......?

</Bubble>

<Image src="/img/tl/sanctuary/8/2.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1560" height="720" quality="100" />

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

It's fine. Let's eat before it gets cold. Thank you for the food~♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Ah yes, thank you... Wait, who are we thanking again?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

It's just a saying we use before eating to show our gratitude.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Got it. And about these... Is this how you use them?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Oh, so you remember how to use chopsticks? You used the knife and the microwave just fine when we were cooking together too...

So skills related to your implicit memory are still intact, but you don't have any—what's it called—episodic memory...?<Fn num="2">[Episodic memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_memory) is a kind of explicit memory that involves the memory of past experiences. The type of implicit memory Tomoya is specifically referring to is called [procedural memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_memory), which helps one perform skills and actions without thinking.</Fn>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Uh-huh...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Oh, I'm just saying whatever comes to mind. I don't really know much, so take everything with a grain of salt...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

But you still know more than me, since I don't remember anything. I'm counting on you, Tomoya-kun~♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Mhm. "Counting on me," huh...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Indeed. If I do something weird, please point it out and I'll correct my behavior.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Honestly? The more normal you act, the stranger it seems.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Oh? Is that how I was?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Hmm... Maybe you'll remember something if I tell you stories about ourselves, but my memory's not that great either.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Ah, that would help a lot. You're so kind.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Anyone who has an acquaintance with amnesia would do the same though...

I should really take you to a doctor, but those monster things are still wandering around... I'm too scared to go outside.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

What do you mean by "monster"?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

You can look out the window if you're curious. They've been loitering outside this apartment for hours.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hmm? Is it normal for monsters to come out? I'd say this is pretty weird though?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Of _course_ it's not normal. Maybe this is just another dream...?

I have no idea what's going on. I also heard stuff about other units being trapped in weird places like a desert or a jungle...<Fn num="3">Alluding to _[Satellite](https://yoroshikilled.dreamwidth.org/10838.html)_ and _[Sandstorm](https://fortunebanquet.tumblr.com/post/659604958452367360/sandstormprologue)._</Fn>

This year's SS is just weird as a whole.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

"SS"...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

I have to explain that to you too, huh? If this is all an act, then please cut it out. It's getting quite troublesome.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I... I'm not sure what to say. I truly don't remember anything.

I'm sorry for the trouble I caused, Tomoya-kun.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ah, don't apologize...

<Thought>{`(Urgh... I'm losing it again. Sure, he always laughs his ass off while giving me hell...)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But he's strangely well-behaved right now... Did his personality change when he lost his memory?)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Is this really how he's like when he's not acting? The _true_ Hibiki-senpai?)`}</Thought>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Um, Tomoya-kun.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

What now... Sorry if the food isn't to your tastes. I'm not much of a chef...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Oh no, it's delicious. Being able to eat with someone makes me happy.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Now that you mention it, you don't usually eat around other people, huh?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Is that so? I see. I'm learning♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

...Anyways, what were you gonna say before?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Oh, right. I've been wondering about this for a while...

What's this thing we have around our wrists?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Oh, this? Some kind of watch, I guess. I don't really know much about it either.

They gave these to everyone half a month before the SS qualifying rounds.

Apparently, I can get SSL$ just by wearing it.

It might be for some experiment, but I don't know what it's intended for.

It doesn't do any harm and I can get money from wearing it... So like, why not? I just have it on like this.

But what this is for is...a mystery. There's a screen on it, but it doesn't display anything.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

A screen? I've been wondering about it for a while... Look, there's some letters on it.

</Bubble>

<Image src="/img/tl/sanctuary/8/3.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1560" height="720" quality="100" />

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Huh? Woah, you're right! I didn't even notice that!

I really am useless, huh... When I'm too focused on one thing, I can't pay attention to anything else.

That aside, err... What does it say—

Ugh, it's in English... Gh... How do I read this?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

_"Welcome to SANCTUARY"—_

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Huh? You can read that, Hibiki-senpai?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Yes. I'm...amazed that I could read this... Maybe there actually are a few things I haven't forgotten how to do.

However, I'm not sure what this "SANCTUARY" we're being welcomed to is...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Hmm... I don't know either. The mystery deepens...!
