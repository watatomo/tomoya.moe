<Cw>Mentions of suicide.</Cw>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

A-Anyways! This diary gives me a foreboding feeling, but we gotta read it! It's the only source of information we have!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Yes. Hmm... It seems that the owner of this diary—who is also the owner of this apartment—was an idol.

What is an..."idol"? From what I heard from you, apparently I'm also this "idol" thing?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

_Hah?_ Don't ask _me!_ You're really sounding like Amagi right now, y'know. Can't you just ask me questions I'd know the answer to?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Wouldn't you say that this is a rather difficult request, though?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Urgh... And here I thought I could finally take the reins by being the one leading _you_ for once.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

"Take the reins"? Do you happen to own a horse?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Oh, shut _up!_

_Anyways,_ looks like the guy who lived here didn't really blow up very much as an idol.

The diary starts off with all these high-spirited declarations like, "Starting today, I'm an idol! I'm gonna work hard to become super popular!"

But it seems that this guy wasn't really good at being one, or just couldn't get any jobs.

He wanted to prove his worth, so he became an underground idol rather than going through ES.

But it's hard for anyone to become a hit idol if they're not under ES nowadays.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Is that so...? "ES"... I lost my memories, so I'm not familiar with it...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

To put it briefly, ES—Ensemble Square—is an organization that's in charge of all of the idols here. Or rather, I guess you can say it's starting to be like that with SS going on.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

"SS"... I don't know about that one either.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Just figure it out yourself. Well, we figured out that the guy who lives here is a failed idol that didn't make it big. And thanks to that, he started to crack more and more over time.

Here he mentions that he couldn't make his dreams come true; the harsh realities of the idol industry were totally paralyzing for him.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Uhh... Poor guy?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Yeah. From that point on, the content's so bad that I can't bear to read more.

He starts talking about his grudge against ES and the other idols in the industry, with statements like "Why am I so useless?" and such. His resentment grows with each page.

The last parts are just...insane.

The words _**"DIE DIE DIE DIE"**_ are written all over here, alongside a drawing of a freaky monster and a stabbed body.

The most recent entry only has scribbled lines... After that, everything's just blank.

What the actual hell is this...? Just skimming through this gives me the most horrible feeling.

Like, is this guy alright? Did he commit s-suicide?! I kinda wanna call the cops right now...!

What if we find his body here...?! I never checked the other rooms because I'd feel bad, but still...!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

......?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Eep?!

W-What is it?! Was that the doorbell right now? Is someone here?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi" name="Police Officer?" unknown>

<Action>\*pounds door\* Hello! This is the police!</Action>

Open up! This is the police!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

P-Police...? We're saved!

Great timing! Uhm, we found something weird in this apartme&NoBreak;—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Wait, Tomoya-kun.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ack?! D-Don't grab me by the neck! Do you want me to die?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Sorry, I wasn't aware of that... So if you grab someone by the neck, they will die. Understood.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ugh... Seriously? What the hell did you stop me for? The police could help us&NoBreak;—

Wait. _We're_ the trespassers here! We just walked into this apartment and ate all the food! A-Are we gonna get arrested?!

But we had no choice! If we explain this weird situation we're in, maybe the officer will understand and take us into custod&NoBreak;—

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Before you do that, are you _really_ sure that voice belongs to a police officer?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Huh...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

That voice sounds very similar to the monsters loitering around...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

U-Um? So...you're saying that a monster took on the disguise of a police officer?

So that it can lure us out and eat us...?! That's the same exact shit I see in movies!

W-Wh-What should we do? This is absolutely INSANE!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hmm... I could be mistaken, but we really should check beforehand.

For some reason, hearing that voice makes me want to run as far away as possible.&NoBreak;<Fn num="1">Take a quick guess: why does Wataru want to run away from this police officer's voice in particular? Does it remind him of someone?</Fn>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi" name="Police Officer?" unknown>

No response, huh? Oh well.

We're coming in. Make sure you all capture the suspect quickly. I don't care if you break an arm or two.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Huuuh?! T-That's dangerous!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

We have to run, Tomoya-kun! Let's go out the other window! Hurry!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Urghh... What the actual _HELL_ is going on?! This shit isn't normal at all...!
