<Bubble character="Tori">

A-Anyways! Everyone, can you take a look at your colliers?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Colly... Ah, these wristwatch thingies? Yes, I'm looking at it\~♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

...... _(Copies Hajime for the time being)_

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Thank you. Heheh, everyone in Ra\*bits is easy to work with. That's why I like you guys so much♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ehehe. It's because we know that Tori-kun won't do anything cruel or deceive us.

Unlike Eichi-onii-chan, who sometimes makes jokes I can't stand.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

...It could become a problem if you put too much faith in us, though.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ah, but rather than trusting fine, I guess I trust Tori-kun\~? Despite being in such a high position, you always treat even people like me so kindly.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

.........

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

...Everyone, please pay attention to the screen of your collier.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Hmm? Ah, something like a phone screen appeared on the wristwatch!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Indeed. This is a rehearsal, or rather an experiment, so the order of things might be a little all over the place—

Originally, when you enter SANCTUARY, you receive this collier in place of an admission ticket.

Simultaneously, any guest with a collier is registered as an idol.

And inside this park, you are treated the same way as an idol.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Uhm...? I'm not really getting it, sorry! So you mean that everyone who enters this park...becomes an idol?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Hmn? But I was already an idol!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Correct. No matter what their upbringing is or what traits they have, in this SANCTUARY, everyone is treated like an idol.

Everything about them, such as their profession or social class, becomes irrelevant after they've paid for the ticket and entered the park.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Yup. I feel we said it before, but this is an amusement park where "anyone can become an idol."

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

And that means...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Have a look at your collier, Hajime.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Okay. Oh, there's something like a social media page now. Not HoldHands, the other one, the one that normal people use.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

There are several choices to pick from, but that one resembles Tw\*tter.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ah, I've heard about that one at least.

I leave the work of managing that kind of general public media to the office staff instead of dealing with it myself—or rather, that's ES' policy, so I haven't touched it at all.

Sometimes they ask for comments, so I do my best to reply through text.

Oh, and I also check the behind-the-scenes pictures taken by the cameraman.

Once all that is done, the agency's account managers upload them at the best times.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

That's the safest thing to do. It's not like you're forbidden to manage your own account, so some people do, but I wouldn't recommend it because you might get caught in some messy drama.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Hehe. And then there are people like Crazy:B and Valkyrie who purposefully rile the masses.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

I don't really think Valkyrie is doing it on purpose though...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Point is, there's people like that who want to become celebrities and use their online influence to fill their need for approval—

In this SANCTUARY, you can more or less fulfill that need.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

In other words...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Look. The moment you entered the park, your account was operational.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Oh, you're right. It says there's an account with the name "Hajime Shino," even though I don't remember making it.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Yup. Don't worry. It's not a real Tw\*tter account. It only exists in your collier.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ah, yeah, it might've been troublesome if I made an account out of nowhere of my own accord.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Yep. You can consider it a game or playing pretend. Something like that.
