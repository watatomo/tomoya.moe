<Bubble character="Tomoya">

So let me get this straight: you threw me into hell just for the shits and giggles? Screw you.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

You poor thing... Come here, Tomo-chin. Lemme give you a big hug.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

You mustn't pamper him too much, Nito-kun. I'm certain Mashiro-kun would find knowing the worst of the worst very worthwhile.

As the leader of Ra<span className="noCase">\*</span>bits, he should be his own boss.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Are you saying that you put me through hell so that I'll be _desensitized?_

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Yep&NoBreak;♪ Although I can't say I didn't do it out of spite over you being Wataru's favorite.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

You really are just like a child.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Because I am, both in ES and the idol industry.

However, I can't be a child forever. I should, at the very least, prepare for adulthood.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

...You're not the only one, Eichi-sama.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Tehehe&NoBreak;♪ That's right. We shall follow you to the depths of hell!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

You're all absolutely _insane._

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Quite so! We've ascended to a place so high above that the majority of Earth's population looks like ants.

</Bubble>

<Image src="/img/tl/sanctuary/36/2.jpg" alt="Chapter image 2" layout="responsive" width="1560" height="720" quality="100" />

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Which is why we need someone to pull us down every once in a while.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Gah?! Don't wrap your hair around meee! What's _this_ supposed to get across?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I'm not telling&NoBreak;♪

Regardless, let us think, children. As mere humans who possess neither fangs nor claws, we must instead fight with our minds.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

For sure. I may be stupid, but I'll use my brain to make sure we'll never get manipulated like this again.

<Thought>{`(...Tenshouin separated me from the rest of Ra<span className="noCase">\*</span>bits because he wanted to see how they'll react without having me as a role model.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(When I'm around, the kids seek guidance from me because they have faith in me.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Or rather, they'll just follow me.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Tomo-chin's leading everyone now. Last year, I was always the one showing them the way.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(There's no point in me looking over there out of habit.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`('Sides, Ra<span className="noCase">\*</span>bits are good kids. I know how they usually act and think to an extent. They won't do anything that's uncalled-for.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(This makes it easy to collect precise data from them, and easy to see how much SANCTUARY would've affected them.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(That's why they made us test subjects.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(We weren't seen as threats or a nuisance. We were nothing but "useful tools" to them.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Well, that sure pisses me off. Maybe I should just go apeshit.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Nah... That'll only give me temporary relief. Instead of acting on impulse, I <span className="hold">should—)</span>`}</Thought>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Hm? What is it, Nito-kun?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Now that we're all in these lovely outfits, why don't we put on a performance? 'Course, fine'll be paying for ALL the trouble we had to go through.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

With pleasure. I was planning to do that since the beginning. Searching for Mashiro-kun was lower on my priority list.

Right from the start, we were always intending to hold a concert to mark the end of the experiment.

We'd gather all the idols in Kanto, including those who had already left SANCTUARY, and have them happily join us on stage for the grand finale.

We'll all guide these unmotivated idols, hold hands with them, and dance merrily.

By broadcasting this concert across the country, we'll let the whole world know just how magnificent SANCTUARY is. In doing so, the experiment will come to an end.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Tch. So everyone lives happily ever after. That's just plagiarizing what Trickstar did in the first DDD.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Hehe. They're so admirable because they did "that" like it was nothing.

I'll say it as many times as I have to: I'm a huge Trickstar fan.

However, they've become so exceptional and detached that they can no longer sympathize with the public.

The other idols' reactions in Hokkaido are an example of that.

They are no longer "your friendly neighborhood" Trickstar. They are now individuals people chase after, just like Wataru.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

.........

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Like the Five Eccentrics, and like us, fine, who conquered Yumenosaki and now are part of the Big Three.

The average idol could only ever dream of becoming us.

Because they're special, because they're geniuses, because they're loved by fate, they can perform miracles.

If you put it that way, less people would want to be like us or _think_ they could be like us.

That is what SANCTUARY is for.

Here, anyone can succeed regardless of talent. A special, happy fate that one can experience first-hand.

Here, anyone can become Trickstar—the protagonist of their own story.

By experiencing that feeling, one can hope to live a happy life, and precisely because of that feeling of anticipation&NoBreak;—

Everyone is determined to reach the stars and march forward.

We no longer need Trickstar to change people's minds.

Just turn the miracle they created into a fun amusement park ride anyone can experience.

That's what SANCTUARY is.

That is my new revolution.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

See, this is exactly why people despise you. You claim to be a huuuge fan of Trickstar and then you toss them away once they're no longer needed. No one's gonna trust you with the shit you do.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

So what?

No matter how many people I hurt, no matter what happens, I must carry on this revolution. Otherwise, all these sacrifices would be worth nothing.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Hm... So this is how you justify yourself, huh? You son of a motherless goat.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

...I wonder if there'll ever a day where we'll be glad that it was _you_ who defeated us.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

I hope there will be one. Rather than asking for your forgiveness, I'd like to express my gratitude for the wonderful gift you've given me.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Y'know, I can't stand your damn ass.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Why, thank you, Nito-kun.
