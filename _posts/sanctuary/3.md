<Cw>Death threats.</Cw>

<Bubble character="Gatekeeper">

Well, whatever. Just don't make me repeat myself, Nazuna Nito, and sit your ass down already. Only thing you're good for right now's a bit of conversation.

Go ahead and look for those friends of yours all you like, but you ain't gonna find the rest of Ra<span className="noCase">\*</span>bits anywhere. Wouldn't matter even if you did, anyway, there's not a chance of you reachin' them.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

"Not a chance"...? What do you mean? What did you do to them?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Gatekeeper">

Don't get snappy with me, it's pissin' me off. The rest of the world seems to think that kinda thing is cute, but I ain't the rest of the world, see?

Still, you're actin' pretty damn stupid. You oughta be tryin' to humor me, gettin' me to drop my guard so I'll spill the beans on the stuff you wanna know.

Lemme say it again, since it didn't seem like you were listenin' right the first time: the lives of your friends are in my hands.

I'm not askin' you to kiss my ass or anythin' like that Aoba moron <span className="hold">did,<Fn num="1">An allusion to _[SHINSEKAI](https://fortunebanquet.tumblr.com/post/659602675935182848/shinsekai-strange-new-world-magicians-of-es-3)._</Fn></span> but you should at least know that in this world, givin' off a shinin' first impression and bein' on good terms with people is the secret key to success.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Aoba? Tsumugi-chin's gotten himself involved in some kind of conspiracy _again?_

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Gatekeeper">

...Yeesh, it's exhaustin' as hell to talk to total idiots like you.

Tenshouin too—just why did he pull a move like this? Whatever. Thinkin' about it, you're not gonna pose a problem to my plan after all.

I might be able to just lead you on and get all the information I need outta ya without revealin' my own hand.

And if not, you can still be a pretty amusin' plaything.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Are ya tryin' to pick a fight? I'm not some goody two shoes that'll stay put for as long as you want, you know~?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Gatekeeper">

You _will._ Need a reason? How about this: if you make me repeat myself...I'll kill you.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

.........

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Gatekeeper">

So, Nazuna Nito. How can I drill into that flea brain of yours what I wanna get across?

People that're driven by emotion are such a pain in the ass, like animals that need to be taught some discipline.

Well, whatever. Anzu, give our guest some tea. This midwinter air's so dry, I'll bet even Nito's throat is parched.

...Huh? Why are you bringin' up that restriction I gave you, the one about not bein' able to interact with ES idols?

And now you're whinin' about how you ain't my subordinate or my servant, so you ain't got a reason to obey my orders?

No, you _are_ my subordinate. I'm the president of the SS Administration Committee, and you're a member of it, so you'd better <span className="hold">listen—</span>

<Image src="/img/tl/sanctuary/3/2.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1560" height="720" quality="100" />

<Bubble character="Gatekeeper">

Tch, and now you're ignorin' me. You hate me that much, huh?

That Anzu chick's always like this. Don't ya think she's actin' real nasty, Nito?

Anyway, back to business. I don't even mind if the replies I get are short, I just ain't in much of a mood to monologue to myself forever. Let's chat.

Think about it this way, you're helpin' me out... So let's get some conversation goin', Nito.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

<Thought>{`(...? What's up with that? Why does he wanna talk to me?)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Normally he'd completely ignore us. I feel like he's contradicting himself...)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But, uuugh, I'm not really the best at bringing someone's real intentions to light.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Even though I was a student at Yumenosaki, where deceiving and tricking others was basically the norm.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(I always left the thinking to someone else, and it was only last year that I started having a will of my own. In that sense, I have the same level of experience as Tomo-chin and the others—I'm still a newbie.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Because I'm someone who's like that, I don't have the right to be called "senpai" or even "Nii~chan.")`}</Thought>

Hm? Oh, someone poured me tea... Was it you, Anzu? Thanks~♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Gatekeeper">

What? So you ain't doin' this 'cause I told you to, but 'cause you just decided all on your own that you wanted to pour your beloved upperclassman some tea?

See, this is _exactly_ the shit I'm talkin' about. This girl just won't give in.

Even bein' trapped all alone as she is, with the idols she relies on so much scattered like the wind cross-country...

Her eyes are still sparklin'. Just give up already. You'd be happier if you became a puppet that just moves based on my orders, y'know?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

...You sure are strong, Anzu-chin.

</Bubble>

<Image src="/img/tl/sanctuary/3/3.jpg" layout="responsive" width="1560" height="720" quality="100" />

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

<Thought>{`(The fact that she's like this is exactly how she managed to gain the trust of even idols with the strangest of personalities. All to be their producer.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(I don't know everything that happened, but it looks like she's had her freedom taken away...)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But as long as she doesn't give up, she can still win. Because you, Anzu, are also part of Trickstar.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Turning a desperate losing situation around and winning is a walk in the park for you.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(In that case, I want to at least avoid becoming an obstacle to <span className="hold">you—)</span>`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(No. I'll do whatever _I_ can do best. Just like how last year, we all went against the will of the student council together.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Ahaha. I feel a whole lot better somehow~♪)`}</Thought>
