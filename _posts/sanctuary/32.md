Of course, Tomoya-kun is an extremely fascinating character to me as well.

That boy is truly insane. He's easily swayed by the environment, but no matter what he does, he's still "normal"!

To be "normal" is to be a focal point. Intentionally or unintentionally, he has always taken center stage before the world.

No matter the setting or surrounding cast, Tomoya-kun always acts like himself.

It's hard to single him out when he's always with the crowd. Ultimately, he's carved out a safe station in life.

Even after spending so much of last year around someone like me, a total nonconformist, he still takes to everything like a duck to water, no?

Even up to this point, he's never broken down. He's retained his pure <span className="hold">white<Fn num="1">Tomoya's last name, Mashiro (真白), translates to "pure white" or "blank." Numerous characters, especially Wataru, reference it.</Fn></span> self, never taking on my colors.

That's not something you just imitate.

Just what is it about him? He's so markedly different from Hokuto-kun, who can only follow his programming. Ah, how fascinating...&NoBreak;♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

You've really taken a liking to that boy, huh?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Jealous, are we?&nbsp;♪ It's fine to just follow the lead if you want the mere gist of the story&NoBreak;—

But to fully understand a story to its core, you must pay attention to all its characters!

And in real life, there are no "lead roles" or "supporting roles"! Everyone is worthy of attention!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Hm, I see. So that's what it's all about.

So you truly wanted to enjoy yourself purely as spectator this time?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I was. Since it seemed like my turn wasn't going to be up until later, I decided to have some fun with all this free time.

I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I've always found it regrettable that I didn't have anyone to call a "friend" until I was in high school.

I never had any friends to play with when I was young. I was too busy practicing and performing tricks to please everyone around me.

And thus, I hypnotized myself to revert my memory to be that of a child's.

I did have fun engaging in tomfoolery with a boy I thought I could befriend at the amusement park you all worked so hard to build.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

You decided to engage in **tom**foolery with **Tom**oya Mashiro, <span className="hold">huh.<Fn num="2">Tomoya (友也) contains the kanji for friend (友). Eichi suggests that Wataru befriended him just for that—which obviously isn't the case.</Fn></span>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I didn't pick him just because of one of your silly puns, of course. Tomoya-kun and I are actually quite similar: we share the same dream.

And that is that we might've been good friends if we met as kids.

It's impossible now; the gap between us is too large. But maybe if I were five again, there'd be a chance.

Back then, I acted like a good boy to avoid hurting others. I loved everyone. I "got along" with everyone. The price was that I felt lonely, as I never truly asserted myself.

If I had been with that boy, who'd notice such a pitiable child and reach out to them...

Perhaps we could've become friends and played together.

That's what I always hoped.

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Though, as I'm sure you're already aware, I am absolutely _terrible_ at acting in my own interests!

So I asked Mr. Gatekeeper to give me an <span className="hold">order.<Fn num="3">In the following lines, Wataru uses 命令 (translated as "order," lowercase).

Perhaps he intended to give me an Order under which I had to follow his every command, so as to keep you in check.

But I exploited that desire to get the order _I_ wanted.

That way, even if you were to condemn my selfish behavior, I could say I was merely following my Order.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Why would I scold you for that? If there's something you want to do, then you should just do it.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I suppose so. Though I've never performed such a selfish act before.

I was filled with worry, like a child disobeying his parents for the first time.

I can't stand the thought of getting scolded! I was trying to minimize the repercussions as much as I could!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

...And I once cast you as a villain that would be rejected and booed at by the world.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

That was just a role I played. What happens on stage has no connection to reality.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

I thought you considered your whole _life_ as a play.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I thought so too. But I was only pretending to not see the real me being chased off into the wings of an endlessly expanding stage.

And in the wings of that dazzling, brilliant stage, in an abyss where none could see, stood a crying lonesome child beyond salvation.

It was that sharp-eyed Tomoya-kun who found that child for the first time—he found _me._

That child was starved for love and simple pleasures that everyone else was ordinarily given.

So I decided to spoil him a little this time.

I've repeatedly told you to take a break from working all the time, to let yourself play around, to take better care of yourself... So it's only fair that I'd do the same.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

...Yes, I truly _am_ jealous.

You chose to play with that boy instead of me.

Oh, if only I were meaner to Mashiro-kun.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Meaner? That's what you consider to be "mean"?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Well, it's child's play compared to the atrocities you committed in the drama club.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hehehe. Tomoya-kun did become surprisingly strong due to those experiences.

Which means he'll brush off every single one of your pranks. Once it's his time, he'll gallantly run onto the stage, give it his all, and move forward. Just as a lead actor should.
