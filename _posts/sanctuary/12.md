<Thought>{`(Hmm... Hmm...?)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(What's up with this weird feeling I've had for a while...?)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Ever since the SS qualifiers started, I've been having lots of fun. The four of us in fine have been appearing on stage and making steady progress.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Of course, no one could possibly be on par with us. But that was just expected since we're the strongest of them all.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(In Yumenosaki, we've always been top idols, and in ES we even get called part of the "Big Three.")`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(In the world of idols, you need to be shrewd. You can't get far relying on luck alone; you need a reputation to keep you going too.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(We're the real deal. We really are strong. That's why it's no surprise we won, of course we'll succeed—)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(...And here in the Kanto region where only no-names have been reunited, it's to be expected that we'll have an overwhelming victory.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But I still didn't hold back. Because Trickstar were also supposed to be nobodies, and yet I ended up experiencing something horrible—I still haven't forgotten the humiliation from last spring.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(The powerhouse, the strongest, fine, is giving their all on stage. We aren't cutting corners. Of course no one will win over us.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(That's why we should be able to make it through the qualifiers without any problem.)`}</Thought>

.........

<Thought>{`(But I feel like something shifted since yesterday.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Eichi-sama took us to this SANCTUARY that he's been working on since who knows when, and he explained what it means to him.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(He talked about SANCTUARY so passionately, it felt like the SS or the qualifiers didn't mean anything in comparison.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(It reminds me of that time when ES was built. It was so sudden; I was super surprised.)`}</Thought>

<Bubble character="Tori">

<Thought>{`(...Eichi-sama never discusses the important things with me.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(That's why I have no idea what he's thinking about, even now.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But that's also probably because I never ask him anything. I'm too afraid of accidentally bringing up a touchy topic for him.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(As for Eichi-sama, I wonder if he's still trying to make me stay pure. He especially seems to keep me away from nasty topics and things he dislikes.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(He even goes around ordering Yuzuru to cover my ears against my will.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Because of that, neither of us understands what the other is feeling, even though we should have learned something during last year's Starlight Festival.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(It feels like we're about to make the same mistake again.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(What a sorrowful thing that would be.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(.........)`}</Thought>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

...Tori-kun?

What's wrong? You look pale... Oh no! Does your tummy hurt?

What should I do? Umm, the toilet is...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

I'm alright. Why are you always like this? Why do you only ever worry about others?

Even though you're going through a lot of trouble yourself right now by being separated from your friends.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Hehe. We might be separated now, but it's not like death has pulled us apart forever.

Knowing us, we'll once again meet by chance and get on stage together, I'm sure of it.

Just like how Nii~chan returned to us after going to university, or how even Mitsuru-kun came back to normal after losing his memories,&NoBreak;<Fn num="1">Another allusion to _Black Bunny._</Fn> or how Tomoya-kun&NoBreak;—

Ehehe. Tomoya-kun is always close to my side...&NoBreak;♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Uhm, he isn't here now, though. So it's not always.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

O-Our hearts are always together!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

I see... I might be kinda jealous of you, Hajime.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

......?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Young Master.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Agh! Close! You're _way_ too close! What is it?! You're going to be there for me forever and ever? Is it that?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

No. Eichi-sama had some matters to attend to, so he left ahead of us.

We are to guide the two Ra<span className="noCase">\*</span>bits members around.

I presume that won't be an issue. Haven't you already thoroughly learned everything about SANCTUARY?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Eh? Ah—you're right! Eichi-sama left before I could notice!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Have you forgotten? He holds a high position at a conglomerate, meaning he's incredibly busy.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Ugh... Tsukasa's been like that lately too—he's been super busy ever since spring. I wonder if I'm blessed to be able to concentrate solely on being an idol.

<Thought>{`(That's why I shouldn't be asking for more than this.)`}</Thought>

...Ehehe. Should I show you around then?

Michu—Mitsuru, Hajime, follow my lead!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Ahaha! Hime-chan, did you bite your tongue? If my name's too hard to say, you can just call me Bolt&NoBreak;♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Who's that?! Where did _that_ come from? Isn't your name Mitsuru Tenma?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

Wait, oops! That's my name in the drama I was in a few days ago! It seems the director liked me so much that they wrote the character with me in mind?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Geez. Can't believe you'd mistake the name your parents gave you so easily! It's bad if you go around mixing up reality and fiction, you know?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

As they say, one man's mistake is another man's lesson. That goes for the young master too. Ever since you appeared in the _Fist of the Shangri-La Idol,_ you occasionally keep your hair styled in buns.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

T-That's because it's a nice hairstyle! I only do it because it's cute!

Unlike a _certain_ pervert stalker, I don't go around mixing up fiction and reality, 'kay?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Yuuuuu-kuuun...♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Eeeep?! Cut it out! I thought Sena-senpai teleported here all the way from Kansai for a second!

You've been pulling a lot more jokes lately... It's not like that's a bad thing, though, I guess?!
