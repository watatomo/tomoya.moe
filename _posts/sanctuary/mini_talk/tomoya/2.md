I finished patching up Hibiki-senpai's wounds, so now I need to think about what to do next...

Ugh, I'm starving... I need to get something to eat.

Oh well. Sorry to whoever lives here, but I'm gonna have to take some food from your fridge.

</Bubble>

<Mt>

<MiniTalk speaker="Wataru" response="What was that sound?">

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Um, that was my stomach rumbling...

When you get hungry, your stomach contracts and makes that sound. ...Oh, did you forget that too?

</Bubble>

</MiniTalk>

<MiniTalk speaker="Wataru" response="Thank you for taking care of me.">

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

No problem. Helping out someone who's hurt is just the right thing to do.

You would've done the same if you saw someone get hurt, so don't worry about it.

</Bubble>

</MiniTalk>

<MiniTalk speaker="Wataru" response="What should I do?">

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

You're hurt, so you should rest.

...Well, if you don't feel comfortable doing nothing, I'd be happy to have you help me a bit with cooking.

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Hmm, so what's inside this fridge... There's milk and meat...

Oh, there are some vegetables in here too. Alright, I'll go make us some vegetable soup.

There's a lot more food here than I thought there'd be. Now, what to do next...

</Bubble>

<Mt>

<MiniTalk speaker="Wataru" response="Take the celery.">

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

I don't cook all that often, so I'm not really sure what to do with the vegetables I'm not as familiar with...

Well, since we're only making soup, I think we can just get by with putting in whatever feels right.

</Bubble>

</MiniTalk>

<MiniTalk speaker="Wataru" response="Take the jelly.">

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

...Oh, right. I remember you saying that you liked jelly.

Sorry to whoever lives here, but I'll be taking this in the hope that Hibiki-senpai's memory comes back.

</Bubble>

</MiniTalk>

<MiniTalk speaker="Wataru" response="Take the meat.">

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Meat is the best way to bulid up your strength, huh?

Hm, this looks like pork, so I should just cook it, right?

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Okay, all that's left is to add some consommé in the soup.

I was feeling kinda nervous, but we managed to make a surprisingly decent meal. Maybe it's because of the time we've spent staying at the dorms?

Hibiki-senpai, can you bring the food to the table?

</Bubble>

<div className="minitalk__wrapper">
<MiniTalk speaker="Wataru" response="Understood.">

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ah, could you also take two pairs of chopsticks with you?

Oh, if you forgot how to use them...I can teach you.

</Bubble>

</MiniTalk>

<MiniTalk speaker="Wataru" response="Your cooking is good.">

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Hehe, thank you♪

Kanzaki-senpai taught me how to cook, so that helped a lot!

</Bubble>

</MiniTalk>

<MiniTalk speaker="Wataru" response="What is this?">

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Oh, that's jelly. I was thinking we could have some after we eat...

...But jelly is better when it's cold, so I'll put it back in the fridge.
