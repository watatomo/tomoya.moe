I finished patching up Hibiki-senpai's wounds, so now I need to think about what to do next...

Ugh, I'm starving... I need to get something to eat.

Oh well. Sorry to whoever lives here, but I'm gonna have to take some food from your fridge.

</Bubble>

Wataru: What was that sound?

Um, that was my stomach rumbling...

When you get hungry, your stomach contracts and makes that sound. ...Oh, did you forget that too?

Wataru: Thank you for treating me.

No problem. Helping out someone who's hurt is just the right thing to do.

You would've done the same if you saw someone get hurt, so don't worry about it.

Wataru: What should I do?

You're hurt, so you should rest.

...Well, if you don't feel comfortable doing nothing, I'd be happy to have you help me a bit with cooking.

Hmm, so what's inside this fridge... There's milk and meat...

Oh, there are some vegetables in here too. Alright, I'll go make us some vegetable soup.

There's a lot more food here than I thought there'd be. Now, what to do next...

</Bubble>

Wataru: Take the celery.

I don't cook all that often, so I'm not really sure what to do with the vegetables I'm not as familiar with...

Well, since we're only making soup, I think we can just get by with putting in whatever feels right.

Wataru: Take the jelly.

...Oh, right. I remember you saying that you liked jelly.

Sorry to whoever lives here, but I'll be taking this in the hope that Hibiki-senpai's memory comes back.

Wataru: Take the meat.

Meat is the best way to bulid up your strength, huh?

Hm, this looks like pork, so I should just cook it, right?

Okay, all that's left is to add some consommé in the soup.

I was feeling kinda nervous, but we managed to make a surprisingly decent meal. Maybe it's because of the time we've spent staying at the dorms?

Hibiki-senpai, can you bring the food to the table?

</Bubble>

Wataru: Understood.

Ah, could you also take two pairs of chopsticks with you?

Oh, if you forgot how to use them...I can teach you.

Wataru: Your cooking is good.

Hehe, thank you~♪

Kanzaki-senpai taught me how to cook, so that helped a lot!

Wataru: What is this?

Oh, that's jelly. I was thinking we could have some after we eat...

...But jelly is better when it's cold, so I'll put it back in the fridge.
