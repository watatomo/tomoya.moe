<Narration>Several days later. Inside SANCTUARY, at the concert venue.</Narration>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

&lt;Tomoya-kuuuun!&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

&lt;Tomo-chaaaan! Come out wherever you are! It's all okay! We're here!&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

_Amazing!_ My, this is unexpected! I never thought Tomoya-kun would shake off all of his pursuers and disappear further into the Dark Side!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

What about this is _"amazing"?!_ Tomoya-kun isn't even here! Do YOU know where he is? Weren't you with him the whole time?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

What do you expect me to do about <span className="hold">it?<Fn num="1">Wataru said the same phrase to Tomoya in ["Circuit of Happiness (4)."](/tl/sanctuary/17)</Fn></span> Didn't I already tell you that I was a clueless five-year-old boy the whole time I spent with him?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

THAT MAKES NO SENSE! You two are _always_ doing this and that and saying things that we don't...!

</Bubble>

<Image src="/img/tl/sanctuary/33/2.jpg" alt="Chapter image 2" layout="responsive" width="1560" height="720" quality="100" />

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Whoawhoawhoa, pleaseee don't shaaake meee? All the tricks up my sleeve are going to fall out!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Why are you still preparing tricks at a time like _this!_ This isn't the place for that!

Hmph! Each and every single person here is SO weird! Since we have no idea where Tomoya-kun is, we're going to broadcast our performance to all of SANCTUARY&NoBreak;—

Because maybe he'll be able to see it and come back...or something! Why can't we just talk to the police?

If you're doing something you _know_ is illegal, then please STOP! Take a step back and use your common sense! Grr...!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

...This is the first time I've ever seen you so aggressive, Hajime-kun.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

Same here... He still looks cute even when he's angry, but I guess that's just part of his image as an idol.

I never thought he'd be capable of being like that because of his "good boy" attitude, but I'm not disappointed by it.

<Thought>{`(I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I'm a bit jealous of you, Hajime.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(When was the last time I was allowed to throw a childish tantrum like that?)`}</Thought>

...Hey, Eichi-sama.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

What's the matter? Is there something you wish to say to me, my dear Tori?&nbsp;♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tori">

...Never mind. It's nothing.

<Thought>{`(No. This isn't the time to have some kind of explosive tantrum.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Hajime's been a good boy for so long, even though nothing comes out of it... He's been unable to reunite with his dear friend, too.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(I have to do what I can for him, as both his friend and a noble.)`}</Thought>

There's no point in lashing out at Rapunzel, Hajime. You'll only get more confused. The most we can do is to call out to your friend as much as we can.

If it's you reaching out to him, I'm sure he'll come. If he doesn't, I'll teach him a good lesson.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Nghnn? But there's no need to get mad at Tomoya-kun? He's only doing his very best, like always!

The real problem is Eichi-onii-chan using him—no, using _all_ of us as...guinea pigs! In that experiment of his!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

Hehe. Seems like I can't hide my wrongdoings. After all, God's mill grinds slow but <span className="hold">sure.<Fn num="2">A [proverb](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/mills-of-the-gods-grind-slowly) meaning "one's destiny is inevitable even if it takes considerable time to arrive."</Fn></span>

However, I want you to know that I only did this because my Order told me to.

My Secret Order dictates that I must only act according to ES's best interests.

That's why I built SANCTUARY: to acquire more profits for ES. This motivated all of my recent actions.

I have no room for failure. This was the best I could do without violating my Order.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Is that _really_ true? T-Then, there's not much you could do about it, I suppose...

There's no way we can tell what your Order is, so we don't know if you're lying or not... It's a case of the squeaky wheel getting the grease.

<Bubble character="Eichi">

<Thought>{`(Yep. I'm lying. But I'm not going to tell him that.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(I have strong ties with the administrators and I was the one who made the whole system in the first place. I have no Orders whatsoever, secret or not.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Tori and Yuzuru don't have any either. Only Wataru had an Order, which was to keep me in check. The rest of fine were able to do as they please.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(I have a large amount of privilege because I created this system. As a result, we have a great advantage compared to other units.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But that doesn't really matter, hm? We seized all the power in the end.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(The Orders given to the idols are just mere excuses we can use when our actions are questioned.)`}</Thought>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

There's no point in kickin' up a fuss, Hajime-chan! Let's just call out to Tomo-chan as loud as we can!

There's not much we can do, but we've still gotta try our best!

We'll be able to soar higher and run further than the guys who don't, and the scenery'll change too! Hopefully!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

You're right... I somehow got so frustrated—or rather, felt so miserable—that I took my anger out on someone else.

We got used again in the end, huh.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mitsuru">

That's better than bein' ignored! C'mon, Hajime-chan, smile! Tomo-chan will be too scared to come out if ya look like that!

Mhm. Nice comeback. I see that you've grown as well.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Your retort was unsightly. I'm certain you're relieved that you dodged the accusations the young master and Shino-sama threw at you.

But do note that meddling in their affairs and making excuses won't work on them forever.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

I know. Just so we're clear&NoBreak;—

I don't plan on becoming an unscrupulous man that only speaks of idealist nonsense. I am not going to be a fraud.

I WILL change the world. And one day, standing before the version of reality that I've recreated according to my ideals, I'll tell everyone that this is the world I've dreamed of.

Not acting on your ideals is the same as drifting through a dream. I've already left the hospital, and I'm going to tread the waking world with my own two feet.

<Bubble character="Yuzuru">

Really? That sounds like an excuse a bastard child would say to his parents. In other words: a lie.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

That's harsh.
