I'd like to ask you a question if you don't mind... Wataru.

Could you _please_ shut your mouth for a moment, Mashiro-kun? We are in the middle of a very important discussion right now.

What I...think?

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

<Thought>{`(Huh, Hibiki-senpai's attitude just changed! He was pretty carefree just a moment <span className="hold">ago—)</span>`}</Thought>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I've always conveyed "that" through actions—or rather, my entire body—instead of with words, no?

If you weren't able to get the message, then I suppose my skills are lacking. I am deeply embarrassed.

Moreover, it's a failure for an actor to speak extensively about a work's theme while he's not standing upon the stage. Oh, I cannot bear such shame!

How much more do you wish to mock me, Eichi?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

...I suppose I'll accept your intentions as I see them. No, I should think of what I believe as "right."

Just like when you entrusted me with your mask before the second DDD started.<Fn num="2">Referencing _EP:Link._</Fn>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Of course. I won't blame you with your position, but you honestly nitpick things too much, my dear&NoBreak;♪

<Bubble character="Eichi">

.........

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

H-Hey. Uh, I have zero idea what's going on here. Could you explain it to me...please?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Eichi">

No.

If you're genuinely a fan of the actor Wataru Hibiki, then you should be capable of coming up with your own correct interpretation without asking him, the scriptwriter, the director, or anyone else.

You should be like me and cry and mourn and be shameful over the fact that you misunderstood his message. No, _you_ should lament over your own stupidity.

There are frontiers where only those who have been through such pain could reach.

See you, Mashiro-kun.

I am _so_ sorry that I have to do this, but I'll be taking Wataru back now. I need him.

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

...! But... But I need him too!

You already have _everything._ You have an ordinary, loving family. You have friends you could play with. You have others you can chase dreams with.

I envy you. _Truly_ envy you.<Fn num="3">Tomoya said the same thing to Wataru in ["Circuit of Happiness (9)."](/tl/sanctuary/22) Without the "truly" part, of course.</Fn>
