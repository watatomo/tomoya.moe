<Narration>Meanwhile, somewhere within SANCTUARY's Dark Side, in an apartment building called The Depths.</Narration>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ngh...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hm? Is there something wrong, Tomoya-kun? You keep making these "ngh ngh" sounds. Do you not feel well?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Eep! Don't just sneak up behind me like that! Are you some kind of dog?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I'm not a dog—I'm Wataru Hibiki!

I don't particularly connect with this name, but I came to know myself better thanks to the kindness you showed me by telling me about it!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Like I said, I don't even know you that well...

You say something different every time you talk about your family or past. I seriously can't tell what's _really_ true and what's not.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

You don't say? So it seems that I was a pathological liar!&NoBreak;<Fn num="1">A [pathological liar](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-nature-deception/202009/what-is-pathological-lying) is someone who consistently lies to the point where their lives could be put in danger and risks harm to themselves and others.</Fn>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

You're weirdly upfront with me now, though. Gives me the creeps.

I wonder why... I thought I always wanted you to be honest with me.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

......?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

A-Anyways, we used up all the food in the fridge, and we can't just hide in some stranger's home forever&NoBreak;—

So we've gotta come up with some kind of escape plan that'll let us avoid those monsters.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

From what I can see, it doesn't seem like they're going away any time soon...

Each monster walks slightly different. Perhaps they're taking turns walking around?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Huh, so you're telling me that these monsters take _shifts?!_ Whatever. I don't wanna spend the rest of my life stuck here with you, and I'm sure our friends and family are worried sick too.

Let's just get the hell out of here and go back to our normal, saner world.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Yes! If that is what you desire, then I shall follow you through anything and everything!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Like I said earlier, you being so nice and upfront for once really gives me the creeps...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

What do you expect me to do about it? I genuinely don't know how I acted like before, though!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

We _really_ gotta get your memories back soon. But I still feel like you're faking this whole thing.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Is that truly how you're viewing all of this? I'm so sorry!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

There's really no need to apologize...

That aside, we can't just jump out of here with no plan whatsoever. That'd be stupid—there's still all those freaky monsters wandering about.

Maybe it won't be of any help, but I'd like to grab something we might be able to use as a weapon before heading out.

I don't even know where the hell we are. I wish there was a map of this area somewhere... Do you think the bookshelf over there has something like that?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hmm... There are a lot of books and files, but since I lost my memory, it's difficult for me to determine which ones are useful.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Wow, this is the first time Wataru Hibiki has ever been useless.

...Let's see. Oh, it looks like there's some kind of diary over here.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Ohh? Could it belong to the owner of this apartment?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Who lives here, anyways? They haven't come back at all&NoBreak;—

W-Whoa?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hmn?! Did something happen, Tomoya-kun?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

What the hell is this... The first few pages are all normal and such&NoBreak;—

But then it starts getting _really_ dark.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Could I see?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Uweh?! Don't peek from behind! Your stupid long hair is getting in the way!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Apologies. Why did I let my hair grow so long? Would it be better if I cut it?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Hmm... Your hair tends to move on its own quite a bit, so I've been wondering if you were wearing some kind of wig&NoBreak;—

Because if you shaved your hair off, it'd be a lot easier for you to wear wigs for all the roles you play.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Nope. This is all authentic hair. Just look for yourself&NoBreak;♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

What's the point of wrapping your hair around me?! Are you some kind of yokai?!&NoBreak;<Fn num="2">Possibly referencing [Harionago](https://yokai.com/harionago), a yokai in the form of a beautiful woman with extremely long hair tipped with barbs. She has the ability to control her hair and feeds on young men.</Fn> But, ughh, bitching at you sure does take me back...!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Tehehe. I don't know why, but bantering with you makes me quite happy...&NoBreak;♪

I'll tease you, and then you will react in such an adorable way. It's as if our daily lives were made of these precious exchanges.

Somehow, this really puts me at ease.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

So you're telling me that _my_ sanity's getting sacrificed for _yours?!_
