<Narration>On that same day, inside an apartment in Kanto.</Narration>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Hey! Are you okay?! Pull yourself together!

Or, uh, just wake the hell up already~!

———

...? Where...am I?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Oh, thank _god_ you're awake! I was _so_ worried! You weren't reacting to anything, even though your eyes were open!

I expected you to say you were pulling some kind of prank on me once you were fully awake, but you didn't! Are you trying to trick me? I'm actually surprised that you _didn't_ do anything like that!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

You are—

Um, who are you?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Oh, I know this one! You're pretending to have amnesia, huh? And then you forgot _alllll_ about me? Well, enough of that!

It genuinely hurts to be forgotten by you! Don't act like that! You're an _entertainer,_ which means you're supposed to entertain people without hurting their feelings!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

......?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Why are you just staring at me like that?! Are you still not fully awake yet? Christ, every single thing you do pisses me off as always...!

</Bubble>

<Image src="/img/tl/sanctuary/6/3.jpg" alt="Chapter image 3" layout="responsive" width="1560" height="720" quality="100" />

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

But...I'm still _so_ glad that you're awake... I can't find my phone anywhere, and there's some suspicious guys outside...

I couldn't call an ambulance or take you to a hospital.

But you're still seriously injured! You were bleeding so much—I thought you were gonna die!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

......?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Just look at yourself! You have cuts _everywhere!_ I thought all of these scars were just makeup, but they seem real... Plus there's all that blood coming out—

I did my best to patch everything up, but just let me know if anything hurts! Well, I can't really do _everything_ you ask for but...!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

You? Helped...me?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Why do you sound so unsure of yourself?! Don't you always talk my damn ear off, or do you just not have the energy for that right now?!

But in any case, I'm really glad that you're awake... I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now, but you should rest first.

Actually, it's probably better for you to take a shower and eat afterwards. All those wounds won't heal unless you get some nutrition in you, Senpai.

But, like, we _did_ kinda walk into this place without permission... It feels wrong to eat whatever's in the fridge.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Umm? Where...are we?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Hm? You're telling me you don't know either?! I kinda needed you to explain everything to me after you woke up!

I can't really figure it out on my own, y'know... I woke up in some shady alley and found you unconscious nearby.

I couldn't just leave you out there, so I put your arm around my shoulder and carried you...

I was panicking so badly. I knew I needed to get you to a hospital, but&NoBreak;—

We got attacked by some freaky monsters along the way.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Monsters...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Actually, I think they were just people wearing costumes. Monsters don't _really_ exist, right?

Anyways, those things started chasing us, so I panicked and ran away. This apartment was close, so I just jumped right in.&NoBreak;<Fn num="1">Tomoya's Live Skill name references this: Jumping into Trouble. So yes, this implies that he did parkour to get into the apartment—all while carrying Wataru.</Fn>

After that, I locked the door and did what I could to take care of you.

Thanks to a certain _someone,_ I'm used to dealing with crazy stuff like this, so I already knew what to do.

But I still have no idea what's going on\~! So just explain it to me already\~! I can't take it—seriously, I'm at my limit!

I know I said that I'm used to shit like this, but not at this level... Not even after everything you put me through last year.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

You want an...explanation?

I...don't even know who you are.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

_Huh?_

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Or, rather...who am I?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Can you cut that bit out already?! Read the room—you better know when it's a good time to make a joke or not, Masked Pervert!
