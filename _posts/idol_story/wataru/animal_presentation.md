<Bubble character="Subaru">

Daikichi, Leon, lookie here\~☆

Ta-da! It's a frisbee! Whoever gets it first wins the <span className="hold">game! ☆</span>

Allllright☆ Ready and... Fetch!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Koga">

Don't you lose, Leon. You've gotta show everyone that you're better than these chumps!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Do your best, Daikichi. If you get first place, you'll get this gourmet beef <span className="hold">jerky♪</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Heeey, I brought some stuff we can use to set up the obstacle course!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Thanks, Nii\~chan! We could use the chairs and clothes line to make a hurdle.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Koga">

Woah, you brought some nets too. They're a must for obstacle races, but why the hell were these even in the dorms?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

I brought these from Yumenosaki. I asked the tennis team's advisor if I could borrow some, but he ended up just giving me all of these old nets.

He was about to throw them all away, so he was glad I could take them off his hands.

...Oh, look at Leon. He's jumping around with a frisbee in his mouth\~

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Koga">

That's my partner for ya. He didn't even break a sweat.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Subaru">

You worked really hard, didn't you, Daikichi? There, there. You're deeefinitely gonna win next time...☆

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Both Leon and Daikichi seem quite happy. Animals really do heal your soul...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

You're the only one in ANIMALS that doesn't have a pet, Tomo-chin. Don't you want one?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Yeah. You're allowed to keep pets here, so I guess it'd be fine to have one...♪

But I never had a pet before. Do you guys have any recommendations for a beginner?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Koga">

A dog, obviously. I get if ya dunno what _breed_ to get, though.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Subaru">

Yup! Dogs are great\~ They're obedient; and they'll keep you in great shape too 'cause you'll need to walk 'em every <span className="hold">day☆</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Rabbits are just as great! They're easy to take care of—and more importantly, they're super <span className="hold">cute! ♪</span>

If you're a beginner, maybe a pet you can keep indoors—like a hamster—would be good. I heard hedgehogs are easy to take care of too.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Huh, you can keep hedgehogs as pets?

I guess those are good too... But like, I'm a bit overwhelmed with all the choices.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Koga">

Point is, you've gotta take responsibility of 'em 'til the end, got that? Pets aren't just any other animals. They're your partners, your family.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ah, right. Humans have longer life spans than most animals, huh...

I remember now. I never wanted to have a pet because it'd be so hard to say goodbye to them.

The more we spend time together, the more painful it'd be to part with them...

</Bubble>

<Bubble hidden character="Wataru">

Ah, but aren't you aware that you'll miss out on so many important encounters if you fear parting too much?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Whoa! Was that Hibiki-senpai?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Yeah. Who else would that be, anyway?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Subaru">

Huh? There's something moving in your shirt, Tomoya-kun.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Eh— Eeek?! When did a dove get in here?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

My dove isn't the only one here; I've come along as well.

Greetings from behind your back! 'Tis I, your Wataru Hibiki...☆

I'm practically green with envy, seeing all the members of ANIMALS enjoy themselves without me! How lonely it is to be left out! Sniff, sniff.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Koga">

The hell are ya sayin'? _You're_ the one who told us you couldn't come 'cause of work.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hehehe, that's correct...☆ However, I managed to finish earlier than expected, so I came to join you all.

By the way, Tomoya-kun. Do you have any recollection of that dove you're holding?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

"Recollection"... Ah, is this Jeanne <span className="hold">d'Arc?<Fn num="1">A reference to Tomoya's Idol Story from ! era, _[Cinderella Burning at the Stake's Stage](/tl/idol_story/tomoya/cinderella_burning_at_the_stakes_stage)._ Tomoya rescues Jeanne d'Arc, who passed out on the side of a street. She's quite fond of him.</Fn></span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

That's absolutely correct; this is the child you saved. She hasn't been bullied by those around her at all lately, and now—as you can see—she's doing perfectly well.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

"Saved"? You're exaggerating. You were the one who actually took care of her.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

However, if you hadn't brought her to me, I wouldn't have even known she was in such a state. And she surely wouldn't have emerged unscathed either.

So you truly did save her, Tomoya-kun.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

H-Huh... Thanks.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

You were speaking of life spans just now, correct?

As I'm sure you're aware, although there are exceptions, animals tend to have shorter life spans than humans.

But that is precisely why we live with them and watch over them.

We need to create an abundance of memories with them so that we never forget the fact that they lived here, by our sides. That is the duty of us creatures who live longer, I believe.

In any case, I cannot recommend that you take a pet under your wing on a mere whim. Until you come to a proper decision, it would be best for you to satisfy yourself with ANIMALS' activities.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Subaru">

Yup, yup! Lemme know anytime you wanna go on a walk with Daikichi☆

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Koga">

Leon's a lone wolf, but he'll let you pet him—don't make a habit of it, though.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

And come to my room whenever you feel like spending time with rabbits. I'll make sure you enjoy their fluffiness\~♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Haha... Thank you, everyone!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Speaking of walks... Dogs naturally need them, but were you aware that you can take doves on walks too?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Subaru">

How d'you take _doves_ on walks, though? Do you just put 'em on your shoulders?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Not at all. I take them on walks through the sky in my hot air balloon, you see.

On that note, Tomoya-kun, let us do exactly that...☆

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Woaaah! Don't jump onto the balloon while carrying meee! P-Put me down\~!
