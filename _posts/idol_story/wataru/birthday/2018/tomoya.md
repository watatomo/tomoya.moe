Happy birthday, Masked Perv.

Woah, why are you crying?! Uh, you want me to say it with your name instead?

Ugh\~ Fine...

Happy birthday, President Hibiki!

Hmm...? Did you seriously record all of that?!

The recording's "perfect"? Ah, and those tears were fake?!

Dammit... I just let my guard down because it's your birthday\~!
