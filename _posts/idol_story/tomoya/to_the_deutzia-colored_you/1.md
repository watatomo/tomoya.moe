...Once we blind the audience here, the lights go to blackout. Then we'll change the props and the next scene begins.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

Yeah. I've been able to practice as both roles until now, but it'll be hard to do so in all the scenes after.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Let's stop here for now. I know it's earlier than usual, but can we call it a day?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Keito">

Let's. We do still have some time remaining with this room, however, so I'm leaving you all to your own devices until it runs out.

I'm going to hear what our composer's done for the finishing touches on Dramatica's musical numbers.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Arashi">

That means you'll be on a video call with Leo-kun, right? In that case, I'm going too.

See you later, Hokuto-chan, Tomoya-chan. Break a leg, you <span className="hold">two! ♪</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

Alright. Good work today, Narukami.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Thanks for all the hard work! I'll do my best too!

<Thought>{`(I could practice on my own, but I already memorized all of my lines... I guess I'll just focus on this thing for now.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(My personalized outfit... I was overjoyed when Anzu-san said it was my turn to get one, but...)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(The moment she asked what kind of outfit I'd like, my mind went blank—I totally panicked. It was _so_ embarrassing.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(She told me to tell her if I had any ideas, but I can't even think of a single one that's good...)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(How did everyone else come up with their personalized outfits? Should I go check on HoldHands?)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(...Narukami-senpai looks quite refined. She doesn't have a lot of accessories on, but that's exactly what makes her own beauty stand out.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Kanzaki-senpai's costume has his family crest on it. Doesn't get any better than that, huh? It suits him—he looks really cool.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(It's amazing to see how everyone's characters were brought out.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`("Characters," huh... A personalized outfit is supposed to represent one's character, but there's nothing special about me.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(...Oh, it's a picture of Mitsuru. When he came to show me his, he said something like, "I was thinkin' about what made me wanna become an idol!")`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Maybe I can draw some inspiration from that?)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(The reason why I want to become an idol was because "the idols I saw on TV looked amazing.")`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But there's absolutely _nothing_ special about that! It's so basic! Looks that idea's thrown out the window... Ugh.)`}</Thought>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

Tomoya, what's wrong? Is there something on your mind?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ah, Hokuto-senpai.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

Your acting just now was on point, so I don't believe you have any need to worry about that... However, if you feel you need more practice, I can stay behind with you.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ahaha. Thank you. To be honest, I was actually worrying about something, but it's not related to acting...

It's about my personalized outfit. I can't come up with any ideas no matter what I do.

How were you able to come up with yours, Hokuto-senpai?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

How did I? Mm, I had a person in mind as my target. That's all.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

A "target," huh...

<Thought>{`(My goal is to become a dazzling, magnificent idol. They are pretty much like, admiration personified.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But exactly _what_ do people in this world admire?)`}</Thought>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Sorry for making you come with me.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

I don't mind; my adorable junior asked me to, after all. Anyway, shouldn't you keep trying clothes on?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ah, right. I'll try this outfit on next!

<Thought>{`(I think people admire protagonists in plays and movies.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(So I'm trying out some stage clothes to see if any good ideas pop up. However...)`}</Thought>

The next costume I'll try on is from _One Thousand and One Nights!_

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

Mm. It's just as cute as the Mermaid Prince outfit you tried on before.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Thank you. That's the fifth time in a row you said I was "cute." I was hoping that you'd say something other than that.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to say so each time, it's just how I feel.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

No need to apologize! I'm just bad at being anything that isn't "cute," so it's all on me!

Every word that comes out of your mouth should be written down, framed, and displayed in a museum!

So! I'm gonna try and find an outfit that'll make you say something other than "cute"!

Not this one... And not this one either...

Aha, this is it! I'll try on _The Emperor's New Clothes_ next!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

Hold on, Tomoya. You'll be basically wearing nothing at all with that, so it's not much help as a reference, is it?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

You'll never know unless you try. You might even be surprised at how well it fits.

Besides, everyone else's personalized outfit made them stand out. I wanna stand out just as much as them! If I don't do this, I'll—

</Bubble>

<Bubble unknown character="Wataru" name="???">

Ohh, how splendid!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Woah?! A dove just came out of that sleeve... And it's talking!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

Pull yourself together, Tomoya. No matter how you look at it, this is just one of _that_ guy's tricks.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

"That guy's"... Ah.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hehehe. So the both of you are thinking of me?

Well, you're correct! The one who spoke just now was not this dove, but rather I! Your very own Wataru Hibiki...☆

Tomoya-kun. Have you finally come up with an idea for your personalized outfit after trying on costume after costume?

King Lear, Macbeth, Romeo, Sherlock Holmes, Qin Shi Huang, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Ryoma Sakamoto, Napoleon Bonaparte...

What do you want to be? _Who_ do you want to be?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Huh. "Who"...?

<Thought>{`(With how I kept trying clothes on, it's not surprising I feel this way...)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But I kept trying to become someone else... Is this truly "Tomoya Mashiro"?)`}</Thought>
