<Thought>(...Looks like I misunderstood something.)</Thought>

<Thought>(It's fun acting as other people on stage. Like, it's as if you've become a whole different person.)</Thought>

<Thought>(But that is only the actor "Tomoya Mashiro," not the idol "Tomoya Mashiro.")</Thought>

<Thought>(As an idol on stage, I have to fight as the person I truly am.)</Thought>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Oh? There's truly no need for you to look so despondent.

Everything you wear will suit you, and as such you'll be able to play any role you'd like. Just like your name, you are a canvas of pure white.<Fn num="1">A play on Tomoya&#39;s last name, Mashiro (真白). It can be translated as &quot;pure white&quot; or &quot;blank.&quot; This ties back to the story&#39;s title, <em>To the Deutzia-Colored You,</em> which appears to be from Wataru&#39;s point of view.</Fn> You can be painted in any color; you can become anything your heart desires.

Perhaps I can only view this so positively because it is precisely what I am lacking, but...

Your "problem" is actually a skill that those with strong personalities cannot obtain no matter how desperately they may wish to.

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

That's right, Tomoya. I'm not saying you're cute without any thought, I really do think so.

You can become whoever and whatever you'd like. With that in mind, why don't you think again about what you'd like to be?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Thank you, Hibiki-senpai, Hokuto-senpai...

I'm going to rethink on how to design my personalized outfit from scratch.

<Thought>(I'm watching some idol concerts as reference.)</Thought>

<Thought>(...Idols really are amazing, huh. They're always shining and full of joy.)</Thought>

<Thought>(The venue is completely packed. I used to be right there, just another member of the audience, before I became an idol.)</Thought>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Tomoya-kun, would you like to drink some warm milk with me?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Oh, Hajime... Yeah, sure. Thanks.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Don't mention it. Is it alright if I sit next to you? I'd like to watch the concert too.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Of course. We're friends, after all. You don't have to ask for permission every time.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Ehehehe, alright then. I'll plop right down♪

...Tomoya-kun, are you worried about your personalized outfit by chance?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Uh... What makes you think that?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

We're friends, aren't we? I felt like that might be the case.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Haha, yep. You saw right through me... It's just as you say: I'm worrying about my personalized outfit—to the point where I'm starting to panic a bit.

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Mitsuru was able to come up with a design that suits him, so why can't I do the same?

I don't really know what my idol self is like at all...

I was trying to do what Mitsuru did: use the reason why I became an idol as a reference. However, my reason for becoming an idol is so boring... "The idols I saw on TV looked amazing! Maybe I could become one too," and such...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Mm-mm, I don't think it's a boring reason at all... Do you remember what I told you a long, looong time ago?

I said that I wasn't really interested in idols. That I loved you and didn't want be separated from you, so I just tagged along without a single thought.

Tomoya-kun, _you_ were the one who always stood by my side, no matter how painful and miserable it got.

You befriended me, and even the reason I'm here _now_ is because you wanted to be an idol.

Without you, the idol "Hajime Shino" wouldn't exist. I've always been considered such a dunce by others, so by now I surely would've been left behind in the dust—

I might've even stopped trying to catch up to you. I might've just given up and cried, all alone. So please... Don't call your reason boring.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Hajime... Yeah, I understand.

<Thought>(If I never thought of becoming an idol, I wouldn't be where I'm at now.)</Thought>

<Thought>(I would've never met Mitsuru and Nii\~chan. I would've been living a dull, uneventful life.)</Thought>

<Thought>(Becoming an idol was a critical turning point in life for me. Even though my reason for wanting to be one is pretty boring and worthless, I don't need to keep comparing it to others.)</Thought>

Well, why don't we brainstorm ideas for a personalized outfit together? If you don't mind. You know me too well, anyways...

With you, I feel like I could come up with a design that's like those idols I've always admired—the idols that shine beyond the screen.

<Bubble character="Hajime">

Tomoya-kun... Yes, of course! ♪

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

<Thought>(I finished brainstorming for my personalized outfit, so I brought all the sheets here but...)</Thought>

Hibiki-senpai's not here, huh... Maybe I should've just called him upfront on HoldHands.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hoho. I was wondering who you were searching for—to think that it was me.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Eep! D-Don't just show up out of the blue! You should've just called out to me... Geez.

Here. This is the design for my personalized outfit. I took your advice and such, so I thought I'd better show the final outcome to you.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

So you decided on a design that draws inspiration from idols in the end.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Yeah. I'm not able bring out the idol "Tomoya Mashiro's" character yet... Which is why the classic idol outfit is the best choice!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

A wonderful choice. You're still a blank canvas<Fn num="1">A play on Tomoya&#39;s last name, Mashiro (真白).

I grow more and more eager to observe your growth.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ahaha. I'm also looking forward to what my future as an idol holds.

This is only the first step... With this costume, I shall march towards that future with confidence!

1. A play on Tomoya's last name, Mashiro (真白). It can be translated as "pure white" or "blank." This ties back to the story's title, _To the Deutzia-Colored You,_ which appears to be from Wataru's point of view.
