<Bubble character="Hokuto">

President, do you have a moment? There's something I'd like to discuss with you.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Oh? How rare of you to have business with me, Hokuto-kun!

But I could definitely spare a moment, as this Wataru Hibiki will grant all that you desire! Ahahahaha&NoBreak;☆

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

Why are you hyped up all of a sudden? Calm down. Don't get so close to me, it's suffocating.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Summer is upon us\~! If you don't remember how to sweat correctly, your brain will start to boil due to unregulated body temperature!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

You worry too much. Unlike you, I can't control my sweat. If it gets hot, I'll automatically start sweating.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

You mustn't give up without trying! With training, you, too, can control your sweat! This is negligence, Hokuto-kun. You must aim beyond the stars!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

I don't need _you_ telling me that. For one, I'm not trying to be a human jack-in-a-box.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Who are you calling a "human jack-in-the-box"...? What a perfectly fitting name! _Amazing&NoBreak;☆_

Hehehe. Now then, what would you like to discuss with me?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

Right... President, give him a break already.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Do you know how little that narrows it down? I could think of a vast amount of people when you say that, so you have to be more specific.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

It's about Tomoya. You've been sending your doves to monitor him, correct? They've been bothering him day and night.

Apparently, they also show up whenever he uses the restroom and takes baths. He can't relax because it's like you're always watching him—even in private.

It's an invasion of privacy. Tomoya's close to breaking down... For this reason, I would like you to tell your doves to stop monitoring him.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hmm? It _is_ true that I had a small camera attached to my dove to keep an eye on him.

However, I was getting too bored, so I put an end to that a long time ago.

As an actor, you must always be aware that you're being watched... It's a game for him to understand the most basic of basics.

It wasn't to peek into his daily&nbsp;life.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

Is that so? How odd, that doesn't line up with what I've been told. Tomoya says that there's _still_ a dove following him.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Are you sure it's not him being paranoid? Tomoya-kun must really have some mental issues...

I shall reflect on my actions. It truly troubles me that I have no idea how far is _too_ far.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

That's right. You _better_ reconsider what you've done.

But that sure is strange... Tomoya went through a lot to show me a video of a bird you were going to train for a magic trick.

It's a special breed of dove you don't find around here.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hmm... Whatever could it be?

How mysterious! Aah, there are still so many _amazing_ things hidden in this world...&NoBreak;☆

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

P-P-P-Pre-Preeeez...!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

...Speak of the devil. You startled me. What's wrong, Tomoya?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Oh, good afternoon, Hokuto-senpai! You're as cool today as ever...&NoBreak;☆

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

Hm? Thanks?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Tomoya-kun, Tomoya-kun. Is that my dove you have there? It looks absolutely exhausted... What happened?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

That's what _I'm_ here to ask!

I didn't hear any wing flapping today, so I finally thought that I wasn't being chased anymore... Like I could _finally_ have some peace of mind, y'know?

But something felt off, so I looked around... And there it was, passed out on the side of the road.

It would be really bad if it got ran over by a bicycle and such, so I picked it up right away.

B-But what the hell am I supposed to do now?! This is _your_ bird, so do something about it...!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hehehe. It's wonderful that you can still be kind to the dove who has been chasing you around and causing you anxiety, Tomoya-kun.

Let me have a look. Ah, this is certainly one of my doves... She's been missing for quite some time now. Her name is Jeanne d'Arc.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

Why does she have such a grandiose name?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I named her such because she loves to perch on crosses... Oh dear, there's a fresh wound across her body. Did a stray cat attack you?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

C-Can you help her? I could go grab the first-aid kit from the nurse's office!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Ah, there's no need to do that. I have one right here.

My doves often get scratches whenever we do a play, so I have a first-aid kit on hand at all times&NoBreak;♪

Please hold still, Jeanne d'Arc... This will only take a moment~&NoBreak;♪

...Mhm, you should be alright now. It's fortunate that this isn't a grave injury, so her life isn't in any danger.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

I-Is that so? What a relief...&NoBreak;♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Yes. However, I've been worried for her health, since she hasn't been eating well. I'll make a bed for her to rest in.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Oh, I can look after her!

It's kinda weird—I guess I got attached to her since she's always with me... I was _super_ worried when I saw her on the ground!

It really is weird, huh? That I feel like _this_ towards a dove that's been stalking me around!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Not at all. It's human nature to feel close to things that you've been around with for an extended period of time.

Since I'm always right here for you, isn't it quite like how you two are gradually coming to love me?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

No. To be honest, the more I stick around you, the more it feels like I _don't_ know you at all. Kinda makes me wanna move far away from you.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hokuto">

I know exactly how you feel, Tomoya.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

My underclassmen are so cruel... You made your president sad. Sob, sob.

Anyhow, I'll be taking my dear Jeanne d'Arc home to take care of her. It's likely that I have to train her all over again.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Huh, you can't leave her in the clubroom?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I could, yes. Eichi would likely give me permission to keep an animal here if I were to ask him.

However, Jeanne d'Arc also has scratches from her fellow doves, not just stray cats.

She's been getting bullied by those who are supposed to be her friends.

It's a good thing you saved her quickly.

But she might not be as lucky next time, so I need to isolate her in a safe place.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Huh, bullied...? That's awful. She didn't do anything wrong.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hehehe. It's common for birds to start pecking those who are weak and don't fit in.

She's a bit like Cinderella, wouldn't you say?

And in the fairytale, Cinderella gets rescued by a prince.

But in real life, one can still face persecution even if they were saved by a prince.

People will get envious and say it's unfair—that it's favoritism...

Please keep that in mind, Tomoya-kun.

Animals love you, no? For that reason, someone who adores you could fall into misery by the weight of your fans' "jealousy."

Let this be a lesson to you, to avoid repeating the same tragedy.

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Until you grow to become a prince that can rescue all the Cinderellas in the world.

### Title Breakdown

Jeanne d'Arc was a French soldier that received visions from saints to recover France from England. The royal court was drawn to her possibly due to viewing her as a beacon of hope. She appeared to them during a time the French was defeated numerous of times and were desperate. She led a number of successful military campaigns and boosted French morale. On May 23, 1430, d'Arc was captured by the Burgundian faction and put on trial. After being declared guilty by Pierre Cauchon, she was burned at the stake on May 30, 1431. She was around nineteen years old. d'Arc was canonized as a saint on May 16, 1920.

Based on Charles Perrault's version, Cinderella, a girl with immense kindness, lived in terrible conditions under her stepmother and stepsisters. Her stepsisters received an invitation to the prince's ball and once they depart for it, a fairy godmother came down to Cinderella and transformed her into a fine lady. The whole court, especially the prince, was entranced by her. Having a curfew at midnight, she had to suddenly depart and left behind a glass slipper. The prince vowed to marry the girl that owed it and had all the women in the kingdom try it on. In the end, Cinderella and the prince got married, and her stepsisters got married to other noblemen.

Jeanne d'Arc was a peasant and Cinderella was treated as a servant. However, Cinderella had a happily ever after, while d'Arc died at the stake.

#### Analysis

Jeanne d'Arc (Cinderella) is a parallel of Wataru (particularly from his childhood). The "prince" that saved him were his inherent talents. However, as a result of his immense talent, people moved away from him. The "tragedy" Wataru speaks of is what happened to himself, and tells Tomoya to not end up like him. This is also noted in _Phantom Thieves vs. Detectives,_ as he warns Tomoya that becoming "extraordinary" can cause him to be disconnected from others—he doesn't want Tomoya to become one of "those who don't fit in."

Additionally, the real Jeanne d'Arc was burned at the stake by her own people: the Burgundian party were supporters of the Duke of Burgundy, John the Fearless, a scion of the French royal family. She also lived in an isolated patch that was surrounded by pro-Burgundian lands. In _Elements,_ Wataru was executed by his fellow idols.

Tl;dr: Jeanne d'Arc = Cinderella = Wataru.

<!-- The Cinderella of _Ensemble Stars_ was Wataru all along, not Tomoya (despite him getting the role). It's kinda like a subtle way of Wataru asking Tomoya to become a prince that can save him (which he ends up becoming in _Transparency and Masks_)—the prince that will follow him to the end of the world and beyond. -->
