My head hurts...

<Choice>(Huh? Where the hell am I...?)</Choice>

I slowly awaken from the dark state that surrounded me when&NoBreak;—

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

...Oh, have you woken up?

</Bubble>

<Choice>A-Agnes Tachyon...?</Choice>

<Bubble character="Trainer">

Agnes Tachyon is a horse girl with tremendous ability. Even a rookie trainer like myself has heard of her. But to think that she'd actually stand before me...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

You appear to be a bit confused. You did just regain consciousness, so it's best to not exert yourself.

Go sit on this chair. Make yourself feel at home.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Trainer">

I sat down in the chair just as she said.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

Now then, you're probably wondering how you ended up in this situation. Remember anything?

By the way, I was the one who brought you over here. Therefore, what you need to remember is "how" and "why" you blacked out.

</Bubble>

<Choice>Umm...</Choice>

<Bubble character="Trainer">

I somehow managed to wrap my throbbing head around this. If I recall correctly, I was walking down the hallway when...

<Bubble character="Sakura Bakushin O">

Hoooold it! Tachyon-san, wait right hereeeee!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

Oh my. What ever is the matter, Bakushin O-kun? It's not like your beloved classroom was burned to a crisp.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakura Bakushin O">

Right! It wasn't burned to a crisp!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

So all is well. I shall take my leave.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakura Bakushin O">

The class prez commands you to stooooop! There is nothing "well" about this at all!

It may not be burned to a crisp, but it was very much close to being that!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

There was only a little smoke in the corner, no? Would a class president really be this worked up about that?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakura Bakushin O">

Huh?! Um, hmm... Now that you mention it...

Would a benevolent class president forgive something so trivial like filling an entire classroom with smoke...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

Leniency is a virtue, Class President. If that's all, I'll truly be leaving now&NoBreak;—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakura Bakushin O">

...Wait, no! Come to think of it, the teacher said "bring her to me no matter what she says" eight times!

And because of that, I'm not letting you go so easily, Tachyon-saaaan!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

Ahahaha! You truly won't get fooled, huh?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakura Bakushin O">

I'm not going to let you get awayyyy! Bakushin bakushiiiin!

Ah! Trainer over there! Don't let Tachyon-san get awayyyy!

Hm...? Oop!

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

...Hmm, it seems you have recovered some of your memories.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Trainer">

After regaining memory, I realize that the girl in front of me is the one responsible for covering a whole classroom with smoke...

</Bubble>

<Choice>Why would you do that?</Choice>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

What a strange question to ask. There's no other answer to this other than "it's part of my research"!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Trainer">

When Agnes Tachyon said "research," a mysterious sparkle appeared in her eyes.

</Bubble>

<Choice>I have a bad feeling about this...</Choice>

<Bubble character="Trainer">

It's best to not get involved with her. I was about to stand up when I realized&NoBreak;—

<Action>\*creak\*</Action>

</Bubble>

<Choice>Huh?! I can't move?!</Choice>

<Bubble character="Trainer">

I got tied to the chair without noticing...!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

Are you the type of person to get so lost in thought that you forget your surroundings? I'm also the same, so I can't say I don't know how that feels.

Nevertheless, I shall kindly advise you to keep an eye on your surroundings at all times.

After all, you'll never know when you run into a researcher that's looking for a healthy, adult male test subject.

</Bubble>

<Choice>T-Test subject...?!</Choice>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

As for me, I'd say it's good luck that you came around. Maybe I should thank God every once in a while.

Everyone in the school knows me at this point. I can barely ask anyone to be my test subject before they run away from me.

Despite all of that&NoBreak;— Hahaha! A total newcomer who has never heard of the rumors about me manifested right in front of my eyes! What are the chances?

And so, little guinea pig—I mean, Rookie Trainer.

</Bubble>

<Choice>Did you just call me a guinea pig?!</Choice>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

A fully grown adult mustn't worry about such trivial matters!

That aside, I'll be giving you a&NoBreak;— Actually, since you're big and strong, I'll be giving you three pills to take.

</Bubble>

<Choice>What are these pills for...?</Choice>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

Ghehehe. Well, that is for _you_ to find out.

Don't worry about it... The worst that could happen is both of your legs would start glowing green for while. Isn't that a cute side effect?

What's more important is being able to observe the effects of the human quadriceps contracting caused by this drug.

It is a well known fact that horse girls and humans have almost identical body structures. However, by comparing symptoms from both species, it's possible to develop a new&NoBreak;—

<Bubble character="Manhattan Cafe">

Tachyon-san... What are you doing this time...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

Why, hello, Cafe! What's the matter? Are you going to help me with my experi&NoBreak;—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Manhattan Cafe">

I am not. I'm only here because the teacher's calling you... It seems they want to discuss your participation in the Selectors...

They're waiting. Hurry up and go... _Right now..._

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Agnes Tachyon">

Alright, alright. I get it. No need to make that scary face at me! Looks like we're out of time. I'll be conducting the tests at a later date.

Until we meet again, Rookie Trainer!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Manhattan Cafe">

<Action>\*sigh\* I'll untie you...</Action>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Trainer">

I am—from the bottom of my heart—so grateful that I've been "saved."
