<Narration>That evening.</Narration>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

We've got you now, Izumi-chin! Now put 'em up! You're under arrest!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

we went through a lot of trouble, didn't we\~ it's already "evening", and this story turned out to be as long as an "epic".

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Ugh, and thanks to him, we're becoming the hot topic on HoldHands and other social media.

They're saying stuff like "The Creature Club guys are up to something stupid..." And more and more spectators are coming to see what the fuss is all about.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

fufu. they've given us "donations" in the form of "admission fees" too. should we add them to the "budget" of the "creature clubs"?

if we do so, then we can "solve" our "problems" without having to fight or hurt each other over <span className="hold">it♪</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

I guess that's a pretty idol-like way to do it\~ Putting on a show and getting tips in a <span className="hold">hat.<Fn num="1">In the original text, Nazuna calls the donations "ohineri" (おひねり). Ohineri refers to the tips actors receive in taishu engeki (大衆演劇, lit. "theater for the masses," a genre of Japanese theater), and its name is based on how these tips were originally presented to the actors by wrapping money in a piece of paper, twisting it into a knot, and tossing it on stage during the show. Nowadays, ohineri is usually given by clipping bills or envelopes of money to the actors' clothes, or by handing it to them directly after the show.</Fn></span>

It was only supposed to be a cover-up, but maybe we actually should stream Idol of the Dead and enable donations or something, huh?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

let's think of that after we "solve" everything. all "creatures" that aren't "human" tend to not think so much about the "future".

but even so, they live their lives to the "fullest".

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

We're coming in! Give it up, Izumi-chin! We already know you're in this room\~!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

aah, that's cheating! you went first just when i was saying something "deep"?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

It's your fault for letting you guard down! We're still in the middle of a competition, y'know\~! We at Animals are gonna be the ones to catch Izumi-chin and get a bigger cut of the Creature Club budget!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

not if i can help it\~! Heroes never lose!

Grrragh! Come out, Izumi-chin! You'll pay for the crime of putting your hands on _my_ Tomo-chin with your _life!_

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

w-we won't kill him, right? we're only going to catch him, right?

_Amazing!_ Greetings, my beloved compatriots of the Creature Clubs!

I am neither fin nor fur,<Fn num="2">Literally "neither of the land nor the sea" (陸のものとも海のものともつかない).

Now, allow me to give a proper welcome! Would you like dinner? A bath? Or would you like..._me?_

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

.........

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

wataru.

wait, what are you doing here? what kind of "prank" is this?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Hehehe. But—for the record—I too happen to be a member of ANIMALS, so it's not inconceivable for me to be here, wouldn't you agree?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Yeah, I guess, but... Huh? I swear I heard their voices coming from here—but they're nowhere to be seen? Wait, does that mean the voices I heard were from _you,_ Wataru-chin?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Correct. I just happened to receive a humble request from Tomoya-kun as to whether I could use my mimicry abilities to impersonate them.

With that, I was able to buy them as much time as possible.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

But why would you do that...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Because he asked me to. As if I could _ever_ say no to those adorable puppy-dog eyes he begged me <span className="hold">with~♪</span>

Besides, it's quite rare for Tomoya-kun to ask me for help, so I was over the <span className="hold">moon...♪</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Ack, so we came all the way here for nothing! We've been tricked!

But if Tomo-chin was the one who asked Wataru-chin for the favor, does that mean he doesn't want to get caught either...?

Why? Could it be that Izumi-chin didn't actually abduct Tomo-chin against his will?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

That's about right. And yet you jumped to conclusions and kicked up a massive fuss, creating a far bigger deal out of this than necessary...

I see you're just as easily flustered as ever, Mister Rabbit.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Huh\~? But I'm just _so worried_ about Tomo-chin\~!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I'm sure you are. It's wonderful to hear that you're taking such excellent care of Tomoya-kun, who I entrusted to you.

Though, I wonder if you're too overprotective. Perhaps that's because I tend to favor a harsher training regime that packs a punch so hard it leaves a dent.

But one could say that it strikes a fine balance with your tendency to be a bit _too_ soft on your juniors.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

What are you talking about? More importantly, you seem to be on Tomo-chin's side, since you accepted his request—so where are they now?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Now? Well, you know what they say: a magician never reveals his secrets. So I'm afraid I cannot tell you.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

A magician...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Correct. After all, Tomoya-kun does well when it counts. Or rather, he can do anything he sets his mind to.

He remained calm through this bizarre situation, came up with the best plan he could think of, and pulled off the most magnificent "escape stunt."

_Amazing!_ Pressure makes diamonds, after all!

Being mean to him and having my dove hide the key was worth <span className="hold">it♪</span>
