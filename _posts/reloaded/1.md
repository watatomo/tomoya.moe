<Narration>Early September, Seisou Hall.</Narration>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

...now, let's "talk" about "dinosaurs".

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Why dinosaurs...? We're in the middle of talking about how to split the Creature Clubs' budgets right now—don't change the subject!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

sadly, the "dinosaurs" have all gone "extinct".

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Okay then, so you basically don't intend to listen to a word I say.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

there was a dramatic "change" in the "environment", caused by a "meteorite" colliding into the earth.

it's said that the "dinosaurs" all died out because they couldn't overcome that change.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Oh, yeah\~ I've heard of that. The meteorite made dust cover the entire sky, blocking out the sun and causing the Earth to freeze over.

Since most dinosaurs were cold-blooded, they couldn't move around in the cold, so they couldn't hunt for food and eventually starved to death, right?

But mammals were fine with the cold, because they had fur to keep them warm... or something like that.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

you're so knowledgeable, nazuna.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Nah, I'm just saying what I remember off the top of my head.

More importantly, I can't see where this discussion is going. What're you trying to say? What do dinosaurs have to do with how we split the dorm circles' budget?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

fufu. kids these days always want to jump to a "conclusion".

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

We're the same age, though\~ Don't start talking like Rei-chin.

If you're saying something weirdly cryptic to confuse me and make me agree with you, it's not gonna work.

As the representative of Creature Club: Animals, I won't budge.

In fact, we could have all the money in the world and it still wouldn't be enough, y'know\~ In contrast, you guys at Oceans don't need much money at all, right?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

whose money do you think is used to "purchase" the "fish" and other seafood we eat every day here at "seisou hall"?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Wait, you mean you guys were the ones purchasing the fish we eat at the dorms?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

no, the actual purchasing is done by "suppliers".

but the "decision" of which "fish" to "buy" is left to us at "oceans".

also, if we saw any decrease in our "budget allocation", it would become more difficult to buy more "tanks" for the dorms.

if that happens, i would be in a worse "mood", and the "quality" of "fish" we purchase would drop. are you sure you want that?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

So it's a matter of your mood?! We're talking money right now!

The Creature Clubs get their budgets from ES under the premise that it's used for things like the dorms' pet expenses.

Don't go wasting it on vague stuff like putting yourself in a better mood or something.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

what i'm saying is that using all the "budget" on "land animals" is "unfair".

"seisou hall" is very lacking in "moisture" right now, because none of the "budget" is given to us.

"fish" have "existed" since ancient times long ago, and have survived that which killed the "dinosaurs"...

they're the "great elders" of this planet. can't you show them some more "respect"?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

I'm not looking down on fish or anything. But we don't need to go as far as cutting down on pet expenses, which are absolutely necessary, just to get more tanks to keep fish in.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

the "creature clubs" get a "lot more" money in their "budget" than necessary...

so i'm asking if "oceans" can get even just a little bit more of it.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

No means no! I can't give you guys what we don't have, and the current budget split is just fine!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

ehh\~? that's unfair! that's favoritism! does having a "fur pelt" really make you so much more "important"?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Hmmm\~? But we do need to save up extra money, just in case someone's pet gets sick or something...

......?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

mn? what's the matter, nazuna?

please don't make that "face". i got "worked up" and reacted a little too "harshly", okay? i'm sorry.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

O-Oh, no, that's okay, I understand how you feel, Kanata-chin. But that's not—just, leave that for later and look! Look, over there!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

look at what...?

<Bubble character="Kanata">

...? that's someone from "oceans"—

the lover of "shrimp", izumi.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Yeah, and our Tomo-chin is there too. What are they doing? They're walking so close to each other...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

yes, as if they're a "couple"\~♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Yeah, you're right—they're being kinda weird, huh?! C-Could it be that... that Izumi-chin isn't satisfied with just Mako-chin, and now he's subjecting Tomo-chin to his torment?
