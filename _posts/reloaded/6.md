<Bubble character="Izumi">

Anyway, we've gotta do something about this situation ASAP. Before anyone sees us and causes a commotion, if possible.

It's about time for everyone to get here, too, so we'd better hurry... Though last night we did manage to hide ourselves in your dorm room, since it was empty for some reason.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Yeah... My roommate, Ayase-senpai, hardly shows up at all for some reason. I sometimes feel his presence from inside the ceiling, though.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

I don't know this Ayase person, but you're saying there's _another_ weirdo here now? What _is_ this place, a weirdo factory?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ayase-senpai says and does weird things sometimes, but he's a good person. Probably.

Anyway, let's focus on getting out of these handcuffs as quickly as possible. At this rate, it'll get in the way of our daily lives.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

I've learned that the hard way. Not getting to use one of my hands is already enough of a pain, and neither of us wants to be stuck together until the day we die, right?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Yeah. You keep complaining whenever I try to do anything too, and it feels like I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown any second now...

Uh, or rather, you wouldn't be able to go back to Italy still handcuffed to me.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

Yeah, I doubt they'd let me through airport security looking like this.

We'll just have to do something about this before anyone finds us. Where were you practicing your magic trick? We should try looking there first.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Before that, I wanna get some food... I've skipped a few meals since yesterday because of this whole situation, so I'm starving.

Maybe I should've brought some snacks from my dorm room...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

Haha. Boys your age sure have to eat a lot, don't they, To-mo-ya-kun? Maybe it's because we're practically attached to each other right now, but I can hear your tummy rumbling♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

What? My tummy wasn't rumbling, though?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

Aww, come on, there's no need to be shy. Didn't we take a bath together last night? We're practically <span className="hold">besties♪</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

I-It's not like I had a choice, and I tried my best not to look in your direction—

Wait, huh? I just heard a noise that sounded like a hungry stomach, too. Was that you, Sena-senpai?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

_Excuse me?_ As if I would ever make such an unflattering noise in public!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Speaking of unflattering, how are we gonna use the toilet like this...? We barely managed to take a bath, but it'd be impossible to avoid things when using the toilet, right?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

Don't think of that right now! As long as we somehow get out of these handcuffs before we can't take it anymore, we won't have to worry about that, okay? I'm saying we should take action before that! Don't you understand?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ughh, why do you get all snappy so quickly? The way you're saying it makes it sound like all of this is my fault\~!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

And it's true! If you hadn't practiced that magic trick where I could see you, none of this would—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Subaru">

Uuuurrrggghhh!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

**_Gyyaaaaaaagh?!_**

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ahaha, didn't you just say you wouldn't make unflattering noises, Sena-senpai?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

I-I-I couldn't help it, okay?! Hey you, you orange mop! What's with you all of a sudden? Don't scare us like that!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Subaru">

Uuurrghh, urrraaaghh—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

Wh-What _is_ that? Some sort of impression? I get that you're the one who's been making weird noises all this time, but...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

<Thought>{`(...Oops, better hide the handcuffs before he sees them.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Ughh. Hiding the handcuffs like this makes me feel like I'm on TV with the subtitles saying, "The culprit is finally being arrested!" or something...)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Just what crime did we commit to get ourselves in this mess?)`}</Thought>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

Wh—To-mo-ya-kun! Don't just stand there daydreaming, _do_ something about this orange mop! Ra<span className="noCase">\*</span>bits and Trickstar are friends and stuff, right?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

......?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Subaru">

Urrraaagh♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Eeek?! Wh-Why are you clinging on to me, Akehoshi-senpai?! Stop, Hokuto-senpai and Hajime'll get mad at me...!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Koga">

Grraaaaarrrghh!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Raaaaaaughh\~ as they <span className="hold">say♪</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Huh? What? Oogami-senpai and Sengoku—wh-what's going on? Why are you coming towards us while making weird noises?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

It looks like they're not the only ones being weird, though...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kaoru">

Bleeeaaagh, raaarrgh.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Souma">

Uh, ungghh? Uhhhhgghh—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Eep, there's people acting weirdly coming from downstairs, too!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

Yep, and even people like Kao-kun who wouldn't usually join in on annoying pranks like this are here... H-Hang on, this is so weird that it's actually starting to creep me out...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Subaru">

Urrrrghh—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Eeep?! Th-This guy just tried to _bite_ me! Stop it, Akehoshi-senpai, I thought you were nice?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble hidden character="Nazuna">

"Ding dong ding <span className="hold">dong♪"</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

......?

</Bubble>

<Bubble hidden character="Nazuna">

"This is a public service announcement. There is currently a special event being held in the ES Building—Idol of the Dead."

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

Mmn? Idol of _the what_ now? That's Nazunyan's voice, isn't it?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Yeah, it is. It's been a while, getting to hear Nii\~chan's voice over the speakers like <span className="hold">this...♪</span>
