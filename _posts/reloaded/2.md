<Narration>A few minutes later, Seisou Hallway.</Narration>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

W-W-What are we gonna do now, Sena-senpai?!

This _isn't_ how you said things would go! You swore that it'd be too early for anyone to see us!

But now we've been caught red-handed! And by _Nii\~chan_ of all people!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

Haaa?! Could you watch it with the "Nii\~chan" so close to my ear? It's getting me weirdly excited!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

What even?! Ugh, what is with this guy...?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

Oh, pipe down! Can you not start freaking out just because things didn't go exactly as planned? It's sooo annoying!

It's not like I have psychic powers or something, okay? I'm not God!

Besides, the important thing is being able to deal with it when everything doesn't go according to plan—well? Am I wrong?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Urgh...! It's not that anything you're saying is _wrong,_ it's just that—for some reason, it's hard to agree when _you're_ the one saying it, Sena-senpai!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

And what the hell is that supposed to mean?! Why is it that not one person around here listens to a word I say? It's not every day you come across someone like me, who's practically always right about everything!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Just now! I heard a voice coming from over here...!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

yes! they were talking about something to do with "god". i do feel like this is a very "ominous" sign indeed... it could be just as you feared—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

What's with that grim look on your face all of a sudden?! Do you have any idea why the two of them are acting so suspiciously?

Nngh, even so... I'd really thought that scoundrel Izumi-chin—had calmed down a lot recently, so to speak!

Could it be I just haven't heard anything about what he's been up to while I've been at college and he's been overseas?!

Argh, what do I do? What do you _do_ in a situation like this? Call the police?!

What am I supposed to say? "Sir, I would like to report that my son has been kidnapped by a pervert"?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

nooo, that would be making a far bigger "ordeal" out of this than necessary! we should prioritize confirming the "facts" and proceed with "prudence"!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

Uh, proceed with what now? Y'know, sometimes I haven' godda glue what d' heg you're trynna say—not that I've got any right to talk!

Well, whatever! If we wanna get to the bottom of this, we've gotta grab ahold of Izumi-chin and Tomo-chin!

I'll go wake up a bunch of guys we can trust—once I let them know what's going on, they can help us out!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

alright! we shall make use of a "human wave attack" to track down izumi!

of course, i'll help you out, nazuna. i can't turn back now; that "ship" has already set sail. in return, about our clubs' budgets—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nazuna">

We'll come back to that later! Temporary truce for now! All that matters to me at the moment, Kanata-chin, is rescuing Tomo-chin from Izumi-chin's evil clutches!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanata">

alright! please set your mind at ease, nazuna! "justice" will always prevail in the end!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

Tch?! Urgh?! Grr?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

\*whisper\* P-Please calm down, Sena-senpai! Otherwise they'll find us! And while we're at it, if you keep yanking me around like this, my wrist is going to be in so much pain!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

No—he—how could he?! Nazunyan, of all people—Nazunyan, of all people!

There was absolutely no need for him to call me a—a pervert! He called me a pervert?! Has he always thought of me that way, all this time?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

N-Nii\~chan just has a bit of a sharp tongue when he gets all riled up! If he says anything offensive, please just laugh it off!

More importantly! We should focus on getting ourselves somewhere no one else is going to be around, before Nii\~chan and the others spot us!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

That's exactly what I'm trying to do! Can you quit your whining? If you've got somewhere to go, then go! Go on, shoo!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

But I _can't_—that's what I've been trying to tell you! You're just like Nii\~chan—getting all riled up and completely forgetting your surroundings!

Pleeease try to remember: you and I are acting as one right now! If one of us goes somewhere, the other has to go too! There's no way around it!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

_I know._ Why are you telling me something I am _already aware of._ Oh, you think I'm some kind of idiot, do you?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Aargh, this guy is impossible! He keeps twisting my words and assumes the worst!

I've never been around an upperclassman that acted like _this_ before, so I have no idea what to do! Not like I don't have others who are troublesome in a different way to deal with though!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

What's this about?! Who am I a disappointment to in comparison?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

N-Nobody said anything like that?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Izumi">

That's what it sounded like to me! I knew it, you think I'm some dumbass who can't even tell when he's being insulted, don't you?! I can tell from the way you treat me!

Argh, I've had it! This is sooo ridiculous! Why do I have to be handcuffed to some annoying kid I barely know?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ow, ow, ow?! The handcuffs are chafing my wrist! Will you _please_ just calm down, Sena-senpai? No matter how much of a fuss you make, it's not going to get us anywhere!
