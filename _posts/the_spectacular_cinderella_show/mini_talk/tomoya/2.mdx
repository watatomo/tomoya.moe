&lt;G-Good mornin', Stepmother.&gt;

Mm... That came out stiff, huh.

&lt;Good morning, Stepmother.&gt; Alright, now _that's_ more like Cinderella...&NoBreak;♪

    Alright, sur—wait, why are you acting all excited before I finished my
    sentence?!
</p>
<p>
    Well, you <em>are</em> the club president after all.
</p>
<p>
    So of <em>course</em> you can act Cinderella better than me. I&#39;m still
    learning, y&#39;know.

    What, I&#39;m too straightforward? And you&#39;re a good-for-nothing

Let's see... So I'm Cinderella, Hokuto-senpai's the First Prince...

Hasumi-senpai and Kanzaki-senpai are the stepsisters, Kiryu-senpai's the Second Prince...

And the Masked Pervert's both the Stepmother and Fairy Godmother... It'll be alright. I got this.

<p>Gwah?! Wait, I don&#39;t want flowers&NoBreak;—</p>
<p>...I lost a point? It wasn&#39;t Cinderella-like?</p>

    Urgh... I didn&#39;t act quickly enough, so I can&#39;t blame you for

<p>Err, you did magic right now so...</p>

<p>&lt;I&#39;m sorry, Stepmother.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;I tripped on a bucket of water and flooded the hallway...&gt;</p>

    Hmm. It&#39;s better to do nothing if I&#39;m just going to break the dishes
    and dirty the laundry.

Alright, I'm all fired up now. Time to show the audience what all that practicing was for!

...Ugh, I'm still as nervous as before. Am I even gonna make it to the end?

<p>I know. You gave me this role because you knew I could do it.</p>

    That&#39;s surprising for you to say... Since you&#39;re nothing even{" "}
    <em>like</em> what a club president should be.

<p>
    But I guess what you said resonates
