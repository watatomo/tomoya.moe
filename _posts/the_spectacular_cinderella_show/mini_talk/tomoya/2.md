"G-Good mornin', Stepmother."

Mm... That came out stiff, huh.

"Good morning, Stepmother." Alright, now _that's_ more like Cinderella...♪

<MiniTalk speaker="Wataru" response="Nope. Not even close. Shall I show you an example of how to do it?">

<Possibility

Alright, sur— Wait, why are you acting all excited before I finished my sentence?!

Well, you _are_ the club president after all.

So of _course_ you can act Cinderella better than me. I'm still learning, y'know.

</Bubble>}
rare={<Bubble character="Tomoya">

S-Sure...

What, I'm too straightforward? And you're a good-for-nothing pervert.

I don't have much confidence in my acting, y'know?

Woah, it's the Masked Pervert— I-I mean, Stepmother.

Yeah, yeah. I know, the show starts soon.

I gotta play Cinderella perfectly.

</Bubble>}
rare={<Bubble character="Tomoya">

What was that for?! It's not morning anymore...

Huh? ...Ah, so you were replying as the Stepmother.

Ughh~ I can't get into my role at all.

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Let's see... So I'm Cinderella, Hokuto-senpai's the First Prince...

Hasumi-senpai and Kanzaki-senpai are the stepsisters, Kiryu-senpai's the Second Prince...

And the Masked Pervert's both the Stepmother and Fairy Godmother... It'll be alright. I got this.

Gwah?! Wait, I don't want flowers—

...I lost a point? It wasn't Cinderella-like?

Urgh... I didn't act quickly enough, so I can't blame you for deducting points.

rare={<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Err, you did magic right now so...

"Thank you, Fairy Godmother. With this, I can go to the ball."

Heheh. Ask and you shall receive!

"I finished cleaning not so long ago."

"I'll be preparing your meal next."

...Hm? Oh, I just acted out what I think Cinderella would say.

rare={<Bubble character="Tomoya">

"I'm sorry, Stepmother."

"I tripped on a bucket of water and flooded the hallway..."

Hmm. It's better to do nothing if I'm just going to break the dishes and dirty the laundry.

Breathe in... Breathe out...♪

Alright, I'm all fired up now. Time to show the audience what all that practicing was for!

...Ugh, I'm still as nervous as before. Am I even gonna make it to the end?

<Possibility
normal={<Bubble character="Tomoya">

I know. You gave me this role because you knew I could do it.

Hmm, even though it feels like you just gave it to me for your own amusement...

I still hope you have high expectations for me!

rare={<Bubble character="Tomoya">

...Thank you, President.

It feels weird to express my thanks to you so openly but...

I'm doing my best, so keep your eyes on me, okay?

<MiniTalk speaker="Wataru" response="Believe in yourself.">

<Possibility
normal={<Bubble character="Tomoya">

...I guess.

I can't get into my role if I don't have any confidence in myself.

I would just have to believe that I could do it.

</Bubble>}
rare={<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Believe in...myself?

That's surprising for you to say... Since you're nothing even _like_ what a club president should be.

But I guess what you said resonates<Fn num="1">Tomoya uses "胸に響きました" (mune ni **hibiki**mashita) here. Yes, this is an allusion to Wataru's surname.</Fn> with me. Just a little bit.
