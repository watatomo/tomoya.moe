...No.

<Thought>{`(This painting won't go well with the song Kanade and Mafuyu made.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(...The colors are probably too bright. I gotta redo it.)`}</Thought>

.........

<Thought>{`(I feel like there's something wrong with my paintings lately.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(This feeling started to grow ever since Mafuyu started writing lyrics with a different vibe than usual.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Just what is this feeling? It seems familiar...)`}</Thought>

<Bubble character="Kanade">

&lt;Thanks for coming, everyone. Are you all here?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mafuyu">

&lt;...Here.&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena">

Oh, it's already time? Let me unmute...

&lt;Hi. Yeah, I'm here.&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mizuki">

&lt;Wow, everyone's on time today!&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanade">

&lt;Alright then, let's get to work.&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena">

&lt;Ah... Before that, could I talk to you for a bit?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanade">

&lt;What's wrong, Enanan?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena">

&lt;I'm a bit stuck on the rough for our next song. Mind looking at it?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mizuki">

&lt;Yeah, I could!&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanade">

&lt;Same here. Could you send it on Nightcord?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena">

&lt;...Sure. I just sent it.&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mizuki">

&lt;Lemme see...&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena">

&lt;...How is it?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanade">

&lt;I don't think it's bad.&gt;

&lt;It matches the song and theme.&gt;

&lt;Although...it feels fuzzy.&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mizuki">

&lt;Hmm, I see what you mean. It feels, like, lost?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena">

&lt;Lost...&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanade">

&lt;What do you think, Yuki?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mafuyu">

&lt;.........&gt;

&lt;...The mood isn't bad.&gt;

&lt;It's not inaccurate for K's song, but<span className="noCalt">—&gt;</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena">

&lt;...But?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mafuyu">

&lt;Is this all you have?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena">

&lt;What?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mafuyu">

&lt;It feels like something wants to be said, but it can't be put into words.&gt;

&lt;Is this all you have to say, Ena?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena">

&lt;All I have to say...?&gt;

<Thought>{`(What I wanted to convey when I listened to Kanade's song and read Mafuyu's lyrics...)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(...Is definitely not this.)`}</Thought>

&lt;Are you okay, Enanan?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena">

&lt;It's nothing. Don't worry about it.&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kanade">

&lt;Alright...?&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mizuki">

&lt;Well, we still have time. Let's brainstorm together.&gt;

&lt;I'll come up with a storyboard too!&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena">

&lt;Mhm. Thanks.&gt;

<Thought>{`(...I can't let that happen.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(...I gotta get better and better at drawing.)`}</Thought>

<Narration>A few years ago</Narration>

<Bubble character="Ena">

...Yep, this is good.

<Thought>{`(Today's sketch isn't so bad! Maybe Ms. Yukihira'll even praise me.)`}</Thought>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukihira">

Time's up. I will now start my critique. Everyone, please show your paintings.

I'll start from here. Whose sketch is this?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Futaba" name="???">

T-That's mine, Ms. Yukihira!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukihira">

Miss Futaba Natsuno, huh. Hmm... This is horrific.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Futaba">

!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukihira">

There's no depth. What were you looking at this entire time?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Futaba">

I... Um...!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Students">

&lt;.........&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukihira">

You should be taking note of the plaster figure. Those are the basics. If you want to add depth, look <span className="hold">at—</span>

<Bubble character="Ena" name="Middle Schooler Ena">

<Thought>{`(Her critiques are as harsh as usual... Everyone's shivering in fear.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But I won't get discouraged with just that.)`}</Thought>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukihira">

Moving on. Whose is this?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena" name="Middle Schooler Ena">

That's mine!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukihira">

Miss Shinonome, hm? Let's begin.

Your composition isn't bad. I can clearly tell what the theme and focal point are.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena" name="Middle Schooler Ena">

...! Thank you so much!

<Thought>{`(I-I got praised...! By THE Ms. Yukihira...!)`}</Thought>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukihira">

However, you get zero points for texture. This looks more bronze than plaster.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena" name="Middle Schooler Ena">

Huh...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukihira">

Pay more mind to your midtones in the future. Alright, next.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Student">

Y-Yes!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena" name="Middle Schooler Ena">

.........

<Bubble character="Yukihira">

That's all for today. Class dismissed.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Students">

&lt;Thank you very much!&gt;

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ena" name="Middle Schooler Ena">

Damn... I know what midtones are! I've been here for over half a decade!

<Thought>{`(Ms. Yukihira is just as strict as Dad said. I didn't really get any praise either...)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(She's a famous instructor that won tons of awards... I get that the class is rigid because it's for those who want to attend the Tokyo University of the Arts...)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(But she said my composition "wasn't bad" even though she'd never say that to anyone else.)`}</Thought>

<Thought>{`(Of COURSE I'd get that. After all, I'm gonna become an artist just like <span className="hold">Dad—)</span>`}</Thought>
