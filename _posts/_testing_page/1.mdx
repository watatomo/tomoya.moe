Before you do that, are you _really_ sure that voice belongs to a police officer?

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Huh...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

That voice sounds very similar to the monsters loitering around...

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

U-Um? So...you're saying that a monster took on the disguise of a police officer?

So that it can lure us out and eat us...?! That's the same exact shit I see in movies!

W-Wh-What should we do? This is absolutely INSANE!

<Bubble character="Wataru">

No response, huh? Oh well.

We're coming in. Make sure you all capture the suspect quickly. I don't care if you break an arm or two.

Huuuh?! T-That's dangerous!

We have to run, Tomoya-kun! Let's go out the other window! Hurry!
