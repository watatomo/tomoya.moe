<Narration>10 minutes later.</Narration>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Alright, are the two from the Ninja Association finished changing?

The grand opening event is soon, so apply your makeup quickly. If you're having trouble, I am willing to be of assistance♪

I have plenty of experience as an actor, you know. So I can assist with your makeup...♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Nah, you can't just do makeup—you can do pretty much _anything._

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I can't just do "anything"! For example, if I were thrown into a blast furnace, even I could only give a thumbs up before sinking.<Fn num="1">A reference to <em><a href="https://youtu.be/Y-zUvub8AZA">Terminator 2: Judgement Day</a>.</em></Fn>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

That's such a weird scenario, though?

Anyways... Don't be afraid to let me know if you're having trouble, Sengoku.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Much obliged. Can you check if I have any stains on the back of my jacket, then?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

Ah. If I coul—

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Oh my. It's quite rude to interrupt two friends talking, Mister Phantom.

Let us leave them to themselves and talk about love! I have a feeling you and I are birds of a feather♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

Um... Huh...?

<Thought>{`(Scary! I don't get along _too_ well with this person, but he keeps insisting on getting closer to me?)`}</Thought>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Tehehe. Please don't be afraid! As you are the phantom and I am the clown, don't we both wear a mask?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

W-Where on earth did that pigeon come from...?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

There aren't any tricks or gimmicks around here, tehe♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Hey, what are you two doing? It's almost time for the grand opening, so _please_ stop fooling around!

Especially _you,_ Hibiki-senpai! You're only here because Hokuto-senpai couldn't make it! Control yourself!

You became a full-fledged member of society a _long_ time ago. The academy clearly doesn't have your back anymore.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Ah, the good ol' scolding...☆ However, the real world is far more selective than a school packed with a wide variety of people.

Even impudent behavior can be shadowed with an impudent environment. That is particularly true in show business—a place out of the ordinary.

In retrospect, aren't you still the same old Tomoya-kun? And I don't mean that in a bad way!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

You threw that at me so casually... I'm hurt.

I mean, just because you said it wasn't "in a bad way" doesn't mean you can just go say whatever the hell you please!

Like, I was always told that I'm too "normal" since childhood. Poppin' Party<Fn num="2">"Poppin' Party" is the name of Nazuna's welcome back concert that took place in <em>High Five!</em></Fn> would never happen if I was the same as before.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

That's wonderful. You are raising the standards of what's "normal" in your own way\~ It's a different approach from merely excelling in a single area, and I think it's commendable.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Whatever you just said pisses me off... But that's just who you are.

Sorry for getting carried away, Sengoku. You don't have any stains on your jacket from what I see.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

That's a relief to hear. I finished applying my makeup, so I am all geared up.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ooh, you're pretty good at this.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Ryuseitai has done a lot of work in small venues, so I'm rather skilled at getting myself ready.

Though, I cannot cross-dress, unlike you all in the Drama Club.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

I-I'm also done.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

You are all _amazing_ at this! We must make haste now, Miss Anzu is waiting for us.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Oh, shoot. Is it almost time?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

I hear people discussing the sorts of routines we'll do over there.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

"Routines"...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Correct. Since we are servers, there is practically no need for us to cook. One of those routines appears to be writing with white sauce<Fn num="3">Also known as béchamel sauce. Often used in <a href="https://chefgohan.gnavi.co.jp/detail/4889">omurice</a>, but not really to "write with" unlike ketchup...</Fn> in front of the customers.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

It's like what maid cafés do, right? Where they go <i>"moe moe kyun☆"<Fn num="4"><em>"Moe moe kyun"</em> is an incantation to make food taste delicious. It can be localized as "abracadabra" or "bibbidi bobbidi boo," but they don't give the same cutesy vibe. Popularized by <i><a href="https://youtu.be/PQCuyAHGkUM">K-On!</a></i></Fn></i> while drawing hearts with ketchup?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Heheh. Good guess, Tomoya-kun! It's _exactly_ what you say it is!

As idols and actors, we are sure to be beautiful, graceful, and sometimes adorable! I am certain the customers will be pleased♪

To show the others an example, please write "LOVE" in extra-large letters on my omurice...☆

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tomoya">

Ahaha. This is Dead End Café, so I'll be drawing a skull instead. Is that alright with you? ♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Wataru">

Oh my, even how you treat your superiors has changed\~ Good grief, who taught you these manners?

</Bubble>
