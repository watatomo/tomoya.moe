        I'm the guy who wrote *Dead End Land~* While researching to decide on a chapter name, I came across the [idiom "生死妄念."](https://yoji.jitenon.jp/yojil/5571.html) It means "to be lost<Fn num="1">"迷い" (mayoi) is translated as "lost" here, but it can also mean doubt, delusion, etc. In Buddhism, it refers to the inability to reach enlightenment.</Fn> in your destructive thoughts forever, even when you reincarnate," which suits Mayoi perfectly! He's literally the personification of it! (he's not)
