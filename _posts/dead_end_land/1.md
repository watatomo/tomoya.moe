<Narration>One day in an empty classroom after summer vacation.</Narration>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Mayoi-dono\~! Mayoi-dono, might you happen to be present?

Hm? It appears that no one is here. We made an appointment to meet in the empty classroom after school, but have I arrived here first?

</Bubble>

<Bubble unknown character="Mayoi" name="???">

_Pant, pant..._

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Oh...? Is the sound of breathing perhaps coming from...

...the inside of that broom closet?!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

Chiiiief! I knew you'd notice meeeeee♪ You saw _right_ through my camouflage!

As one would expect from the Ninja Association's leader! I'll follow you for the rest of my <span className="hold">life♪</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Hehe. My suspicions were correct. It is unthinkable for a reliable person like you to have been late to our meeting, so I knew something _had_ to be up.

Anyway, Mayoi-dono, let us begin our club activities for today!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

Certainly, let's. Will we be checking the request box today as well?

I'll start up the PC, and... Oh my, it looks like we received two submissions.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Ooh, what a success! We _just_ set it up this week, but we have already received two submissions... It appears our efforts have been noticed!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

Receiving anonymous requests like this is fun... It feels quite ninja-like.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Well, to be precise, it is hero work. But it fits us too, since we're ninjas of <span className="hold">justice♪</span>

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

"Hero" work?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Ah, it makes sense that you would not know about this. Last year, Morisawa-dono opened a request box and used it to help those in need\~

There was no one to take it over after he graduated, and thus, I received permission to do so.

Morisawa-dono looked delighted; he even said, "It's wonderful that you're reaching out and helping others!"

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

I see... So you're carrying on his legacy.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Well, it is not as if I am only doing this out of a sense of justice like Morisawa-dono did; I'm not nearly as saintly, after all...

...Because someday, the Ninja Association will become the Ninja _Club!_

If we become an official school club, we will undoubtedly gain more members, and we can receive plenty of funding. It will be just one good thing after another!

As the head of the Ninja Association, it is natural for that to be my goal!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

Ufufu. Even if your aim is to obtain a reward, it doesn't change the fact that you're performing good deeds.

If you need stealth, leave it to me. It's a bad habit of mine to flee and hide when I encounter others, but in the context of being a "ninja," that weakness becomes a strength.

And I'd certainly rather be a "ninja" than a "phantom"...♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

"Phantom"...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

Oh, it's nothing. Just a personal matter.

Ah, oops. Chatting with you is so fun that I ended up prolonging our discussion... Shall we take a look at what we received in the request box?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Ah, yes. We should do that.

So, what does the box contain this time?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

The first submission is a request to help clean things up around the school. Judging from the manner of speech, it seems to be from the person who sent in a request earlier this <span className="hold">week<Fn num="1">In-game, the request is said to be from "last week." However, as Shinobu established earlier, the request box was only set up "this week." It was decided that for the sake of consistency and making any sort of sense, we would write it as "earlier this week" in this chapter. This will be fixed if there are any official changes later on.</Fn></span> as well.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Ooh, it surprises me that we'd get a repeat requester.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

Indeed. Perhaps they have been trying to support the Ninja Association by bringing us jobs to help us establish a track record.

I am unsure of who it is, but if they want the Ninja Association to become a real club, they could be someone within Yumenosaki Academy.

Ufufu. It's like they're our "Daddy-Long<span className="hold">-Legs"<Fn num="2">A reference to a [novel of the same name](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daddy-Long-Legs_(novel)>), in which a girl from an orphanage is given money by an unknown benefactor so that she can go to college. Though she is not allowed to know who he is, it's revealed at the end that a man she met during her time in college and grew attached to was her benefactor.</Fn></span>—our mysterious benefactor...♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Hmm. If that is the case, I feel it would certainly be more fun if they could join the Ninja Association and partake in our activities...

No, this also depends on the time frame it is occurring in. Perhaps it could be someone like Mayoi-dono!

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

Huh? M-Me...?

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Of course\~ I never expected a third year to join the Ninja Association.

When I think of how I am able to spend this much time with a companion of mine, my heart overflows with gratitude♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

C-Chiiiiief...♪ _(hugs)_

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

Mayoi-dono\~♪ _(hugs back)_

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

Ufufu. To be on a honeymoon with Chief, with no one getting in our way... It's comfortable to the point where I'd be just fine dying in your aaaaarms...♪

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Shinobu">

You mustn't be so hasty! The pair of us are fated companions who have finally managed to cross paths. It is too early to reach the end of our journey!

There was another request, yes? If so, we must fulfill our duty and be of service.

Look, I see another message there. Given the title, I'm quite curious as to what it may contain.

</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mayoi">

Let's see... Oh, what's this...?

"A Request to the Members of the Ninja Association: Participate in Our Grand Opening Event"...?
